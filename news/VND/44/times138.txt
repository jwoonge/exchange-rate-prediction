Postcards From Asia  Trump’s 12-Day Visit, in Images
Five countries: Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Eleven days — no, make that 12; the trip was extended by a day at the last minute. And for me and other news photographers, countless chances to capture one of the most famous faces in the world in new settings.
President Trump and his entourage went wheels-up from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Friday, Nov. 3, making a stop in Hawaii before heading to Tokyo. The days have been long. Reporters and photographers covering Mr. Trump have generally started work early in the morning, finishing around 10 at night.
Then there was that morning in South Korea when we were told to be ready at 5:45 for a mystery-shrouded venture. But the destination — the DMZ at the border with North Korea — turned out to be shrouded, too. In fog. So the trip was canceled.
The president left the Philippines on Tuesday to return to Washington.
