Irish Voters Speak Out on Landmark Abortion Referendum
Ireland plans to hold a landmark referendum on abortion at the end of May.
Voters will be asked to consider a repeal of Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution, known as the Eighth Amendment, which gives an unborn fetus a right to life equal to that of its mother.
The referendum comes as voters in the traditionally Roman Catholic and socially conservative country have shown increasingly liberal attitudes. But the campaign has been highly divisive and accompanied by fears of foreign influence.
The Times asked readers in Ireland to reflect on the coming referendum. Here is a selection of responses, edited for length and clarity.
