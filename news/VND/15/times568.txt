I’ve always loved border towns and military towns — both are one 2 a.m. away from a scary or magnificent surprise — and Darwin is that rare example of a city that’s both.
It’s hard not to be intrigued.
I’m here interviewing American and Australian military officials for a story about the status of that alliance, but as a first-time visitor to Darwin and the Northern Territory more generally, I’m struck by the degree to which this place feels like Australia in its most concentrated form.
The fact that Darwin is geographically closer to Jakarta than Sydney; the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up 29 percent of the Northern Territory’s population, compared with 2.4 percent of the country’s population over all; the fact that it’s at the center of a military apparatus that includes air cover, naval assets and — for the next six months, 1,250 American marines — all make Darwin unlike any place I’ve ever visited.
Right now, as I write, I can see a red oil tanker and a gray naval destroyer floating in the jellyfish-and-croc-infested water outside my hotel window. On Tuesday, American combat helicopters flew overhead. Yesterday, I ran through a park filled with decaying bunkers from World War II, and dozens of adorable wallabies.
Did I mention the blue-eyed Australian struggling to teach a couple from somewhere in Southeast Asia the meaning of “easy come, easy go”? Or the Aboriginal art that may or may not be authentic? Or the fantastic Vietnamese food?
Unpacking the meaning of all this is clearly going take some assistance. This place looks to me like a hothouse theater for many of the issues we hope to explore more deeply in Australia — especially Australian identity and Australia’s sense of its place in the world; and its relationship to the land and its history.
Darwin and the territory appear to have much to teach. And so I’m curious: For those of you who know this place better than I do, why do you think Darwin matters? What does this border-military town represent to you, and to Australia?
Email me at nytaustralia@nytimes.com with a story or experience that captures the meaning of this place for you, and I’ll share some of your responses in the next newsletter.
Below are a few other items that piqued my interest. And one more thing: We’ve finally named this newsletter. It’s officially called NYT Australia. Now you can tell your friends what to sign up for. And at the risk of revealing something either idiotic or brilliant, you can tell them we almost named it Cooee!

Even if the first entry wasn’t written for a busy dad like me, I’d still love this new book advice column. Readers describe themselves and ask what to read; a smart New York Times editor provides the exact literary treatment you desperately need. Want your own recommendation? Write to matchbook@nytimes.com. Or if you’re shy, just scan our roundup of new paperbacks.

All great cities change. That’s a constant. But whether you’ve never been to London or were there last week, this interactive feature showing what the wordly city is now and what it may soon lose with Brexit is remarkable for its thoughtfulness and immersive visuals.

I admit, I used to be a music snob, a rockist, but then I got a job at Rolling Stone and developed a deep appreciation for the challenge and artistry of great pop music. Lorde seems to share that, and this profile in the magazine of Auckland’s Bjork is just about the best, most revealing thing you’ll read about her. (Jury’s still out on the album, at least for me.)

Turkey. Venezuela. Russia. Their leaders have all used elections to consolidate their authoritarian power. “Manipulating and winning elections has become a kind of exploit in the rules of political legitimacy — a way for would-be autocrats to hack the system,” writes Amanda Taub in this sharp examination of a disturbing global trend.

On Dec. 26, 1974, a New York Times correspondent based in Sydney came to Darwin and wrote an article about a Christmas Day cyclone that “struck at a time when this northern city was striving to shake off the rough frontier reputation that had clung to it since its founding in 1869.” Earlier this month, that Timesman, Ian Stewart, died. He was 88. And in spirit and craft, he was my predecessor: a Times Australia bureau chief; an adventurer; a world traveler; and a lover of books and music. I didn’t know him, but I’ll be reading his old clips and thinking of him often.

So here’s a fun thing you can’t do every day — see bushrangers getting captured.
Michael Maher, an NYT Australia reader and a fellow journalist, was driving through rural New South Wales a few weeks ago, and saw a sign in Braidwood for an elaborate re-enactment of the capture of the Clarke brothers, those notorious rogues who are nonetheless nowhere near as notorious as Ned Kelly.
In any case, it’s the 150th anniversary of their arrest and Braidwood (“a quintessential rural town with a compelling history dating back to the gold rush,” Michael says) is going flat out. There will be 20 local actors involved and more than 300 shots fired (blanks of course) as part of the re-enactment on Sat. April 29. The fun starts at 2:30 p.m.
I’ve just started “True History of the Kelly Gang” so if I can make it to Braidwood, I shall.
