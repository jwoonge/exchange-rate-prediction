Manuel Noriega, Dictator Ousted by U.S. in Panama, Dies at 83
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the brash former dictator of Panama and sometime ally of the United States whose ties to drug trafficking led to his ouster in 1989 in what was then the largest American military action since the Vietnam War, died Monday night in Panama City. He was 83.
President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama announced Mr. Noriegaâ€™s death on Twitter early Tuesday morning.
