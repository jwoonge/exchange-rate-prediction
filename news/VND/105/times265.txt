Oil Tanker Catches Fire in Hong Kong, Killing One and Leaving Two Missing
HONG KONG — An oil tanker caught fire in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, leaving one man dead and rescuers scrambling to find two other crew members who were missing. At least 23 others were rescued.
Crew members on the tanker had been connecting hoses with an oil barge for a refuel, officials said. Then there were three explosions before the tanker went up in flames.
“We could see that the victim who passed away had been burned,” Wong Wai-hang, a police representative, said in a briefing. “There were clear injuries on his head and fractures in his hands and feet.”
The tanker was listing by about 30 degrees, but the authorities said it was not currently at risk of sinking. No oil spills were visible on the water’s surface.
A police spokeswoman said there were 25 Vietnamese crew members on the tanker when the blaze erupted, most of whom were rescued from the waters off the coast of Lamma Island. Four people were injured, including a Singaporean crew member. One critically injured crew member was being treated at an intensive care unit. Rescuers were still searching for two missing Vietnamese crew members.
A photo posted on the Hong Kong police’s Facebook page showed a thick black cloud shrouding the ship, the Aulac Fortune, which is registered in Vietnam.
The accident happened a day after the tanker left the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. It was headed to Thailand and had stopped in Hong Kong to refuel.
Residents on other outlying Hong Kong islands reportedly felt windows shake and heard loud booms when the tanker went up in flames.
Lamma Island is a residential island two miles off the coast of Hong Kong Island.
