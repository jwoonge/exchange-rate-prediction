IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; BRUNEI REGAINS $10 MILLION
Brunei has recovered, with interest, its mislaid $10 million of contra-related aid and is saying it was meant for Central America's poor, not the Nicaraguan rebels, the Malaysian national news agency said today.
Congressional investigators discovered last spring that the money had not gone, as intended, into a Swiss bank account controlled by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North when he was on the National Security Council staff. The funds were found in a Swiss businessman's account.
Investigators said Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams gave the Government of Brunei the wrong account number.
Bernama, the Malaysian news agency, quoted an official of Brunei's Foreign Ministry, Awang Majid bin Abdul Rahim, as telling journalists that the money was given at the United States Government's request purely on humanitarian grounds, for the people of Central America rather than the rebels.
Mr. Awang Majid said the money was never sent to Central America and ''we got back the money with interest,'' according to the news agency.
Brunei's Foreign Minister, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, said June 15 that his brother, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, donated the money ''at the suggestion of the United States for humanitarian assistance.''
Testimony in Washington has indicated that Mr. Abrams asked the Sultan for the money because Congress had denied United States Government aid to the rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
