Duterte Aide Bristles at Times Article, Calling It a ‘Hack Job’
MANILA — The Philippine government sharply criticized The New York Times on Wednesday for an article profiling the country’s president, Rodrigo Duterte, calling it “a well-paid hack job for well-heeled clients with shady motives.”
Ernesto Abella, a presidential spokesman, said in a statement that the article, which appeared on Wednesday in the Philippines, unfairly tracked Mr. Duterte’s rise to power “in the context of violence” while ignoring his positive accomplishments.
The Times article said that as a mayor of Davao City, and as president of the Philippines, Mr. Duterte had encouraged the police and vigilantes to kill thousands of people with impunity. The article also detailed Mr. Duterte’s personal drug use.
Mr. Abella’s statement said that The Times “deliberately fails to mention the many initiatives the president made when he was Davao City mayor.”
He said that since assuming power last year, Mr. Duterte had been actively engaging Muslim and communist rebels in peace talks aimed at ending decades of bloody insurgency. Davao City, Mr. Abella said, has been hailed as one of the “safest cities in the world.”
“One gets the feeling NYT is not interested in presenting the whole truth, only that with which they can bully those who attempt an independent foreign policy,” Mr. Abella said.
The Times made repeated requests to interview Mr. Duterte for the article, both through Mr. Abella and another official spokesman.
And although Mr. Abella denied assertions made in the article, he did not challenge any of the facts presented in it. The article quoted several people close to Mr. Duterte, including lifelong friends, three cabinet officials and three of his siblings.
The report tracked Mr. Duterte’s rise to power, from his childhood to becoming the longtime mayor of Davao in the country’s violence-plagued southern Philippines.
