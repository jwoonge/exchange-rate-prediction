Australia’s absolute refusal to resettle migrants who approach the country by boat sets it apart worldwide, and debate over that policy flared yet again this week as the government tried to shutter its Manus Island detention center even as more than 600 asylum seekers refused to relocate.
The men, refugees from Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and several other countries, said they had no food, no electricity and barely any water, but because they feared they would be attacked anywhere else on the island, they plan to hold out as long as they can.
“If we have to move it will be against our will,” Imran Mohmammad, 23, a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar, told me in an interview.
It’s still not clear how the standoff will end (and we’ll do our best to keep covering it) but as I read and watched the news reports here in Australia, I started to think about how disconnected the discussion in Australia has become from the larger global context.
The migrants on Manus are but a ripple in a much wider sea. All over the globe, displacement is spreading, migration is increasing and dozens of countries are grappling with changing ideas of national identity.
The pace of government policy — the management of migration and its impacts — is simply not keeping up.
For example, according to the United Nations, 65.6 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations by the end of 2016. That was an increase of 300,000 people over 2015.
But the total number of refugees admitted for resettlement last year reached only 189,300, according to government statistics, up from 107,100 in 2015. Australia accepted 27,600 refugees in 2016 compared with 46,700 for Canada and 96,900 for the United States, and even that was nowhere near satisfying the overall need.
In that same period, hundreds of thousands of refugees, mostly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, fled their homes, risking their lives in dangerous boat trips, illegal border crossings and long bus and train journeys, seeking asylum in Western Europe and Scandinavia.
Together they grabbed the public’s attention, at least for a moment.
Then the moment passed.
But it’s worth revisiting.
Below are a dozen photographs that were part of The New York Times 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Photography, for coverage that “captured the resolve of refugees, the perils of their journeys and the struggle of host countries to take them in.”
We’ll be printing and framing these in our Sydney offices, and they’re worth looking at closely as Australia and the world continue to struggle with those who did not ask to flee, but feel that they must.
Share this newsletter with those who might benefit from seeing these images, or better yet, sign-up your friends — we’ll continue to examine this subject and others that link Australia with the world.

A day after an immigrant from Uzbekistan plowed a pickup truck into people along a crowded bicycle path in Manhattan, killing eight, President Trump said he would push Congress to cut immigration rates and end the relatively small “diversity visa program” that brought the driver to the United States.
It’s all another sign of the tensions that mass migration can unleash, and the degree to which Mr. Trump has prioritized stiff resistance to immigrants, as both a candidate and as president.

I used to cover digital culture in the last wave of techno-utopianism (Napster, anyone?) and Amanda Hess has that rare ability to connect the effluence of the internet to larger and more important themes.
Her first video in a new series called “Internetting” focuses on memes and what they say about our political moment. You’ll want to watch it on your phone for the full vertical video effect.

• Waleed Aly argues that Australia’s experience with energy policy and its many fits and starts provides the rest of the world a lesson on climate change: “You can ignore it if you wish, but you cannot outrun it. Eventually the science and economics will catch up with you.”
• David Leonhardt provides a handy guide to what we know and don’t know about Russia’s effort to undermine American democracy.
• Wajahat Ali laments the way “Allahu akbar,” a common Arabic phrase meaning “God is greatest,” has taken on such violent connotations. “I’m 37 years old,” he writes. “In all those years, I, like an overwhelming majority of Muslims, have never uttered ‘Allahu akbar’ before or after committing a violent act.”

Like a lot of you perhaps, I’m deeply enmeshed in the dark 1980s world of “Stranger Things” at the moment.
