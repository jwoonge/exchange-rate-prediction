Boris Johnson Says U.K. Supreme Court ‘Was Wrong’
Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended his attempt to suspend Parliament in the critical weeks ahead of Britain’s deadline to leave the European Union, accusing lawmakers of “sabotaging” Brexit talks and saying the Supreme Court was wrong to rule his actions unlawful.
On Tuesday, the British Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Mr. Johnson had overstepped by trying to cut short lawmakers’ time to challenge his Brexit plans before the deadline, on Oct. 31. Received with jeers and shouts from opposition lawmakers on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson was unapologetic for his actions.
