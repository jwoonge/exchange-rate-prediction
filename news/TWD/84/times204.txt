Hospital Blaze in Taiwan Kills 9 and Injures Dozens
NEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan — An early morning fire raged through a hospital floor filled with elderly patients Monday morning in Taiwan’s largest city, killing at least nine people and injuring two dozen more.
The fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. in a room for patients with chronic or long-term illnesses at the government-run Taipei Hospital in New Taipei City. Within an hour, firefighters had extinguished the blaze. But nine people died, all of whom were patients.
“The cause of the fire is still being investigated,” said Kolas Yotaka, a spokeswoman for Taiwan’s government.
There were 32 patients, 10 nurses and eight other workers on the floor when the fire broke out, according to a fire department statement. The blaze forced officials to transfer 206 patients to other hospitals.
While the rescue efforts seemed to go smoothly, some officials raised concerns about how the fire was able to spread so quickly in such an environment.
Ko Wen-je, the mayor of Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, said he “finds it quite odd” that such a fire was capable of breaking out in the hospital, given that normal hospital design should prevent such blazes. Mr. Ko is also a surgeon.
At the scene of the fire, the windows to the room where the fire started were broken, and there was heavy charring around them extending two floors up.
In July 2016, a fire in a retirement home in New Taipei’s Xindian District killed six people and injured 28. The home was subsequently fined $9,000 for not having enough staff on site — only two employees were present when the fire occurred. The New Taipei government ordered stricter supervision of fire safety standards at retirement homes in the wake of the fire.
