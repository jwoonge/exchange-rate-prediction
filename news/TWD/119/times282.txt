Taiwan Is Hit by Powerful Earthquake
A strong earthquake shook Taiwan on Thursday afternoon, rekindling memories of a deadly tremor that hit the island a year ago.
The magnitude-6.1 earthquake hit at 1:01 p.m. and was centered off the coast of Hualien, on Taiwan’s east coast, according to the United States Geological Service. Powerful shaking was felt in the capital, Taipei, 75 miles to the north, and television footage showed a landslide on the east coast.
The authorities said 17 people were injured, including a man and a woman who were hit by falling rocks while hiking in Taroko Gorge, which cuts through the mountains west of Hualien. There were no immediate reports of fatalities. Taiwan’s Interior Ministry said that it had set up an emergency response center.
All subway service in Taipei was temporarily canceled, Taiwan’s state-run Central News Agency reported.
Taiwan, which sits at the intersection of the Philippine Sea tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate, experiences frequent earthquakes.
A magnitude-6.4 quake in Hualien last year badly damaged buildings and killed at least 17 people.
An earthquake in 2016 killed 117 people, almost all of whom died in a 17-story building that collapsed in the southwestern city of Tainan.
