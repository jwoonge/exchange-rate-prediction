China Confirms Details of Trump-Xi Meeting at Mar-a-Lago
HONG KONG — President Xi Jinping of China will visit President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida next week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday, confirming details of the two leaders’ first summit meeting.
The meeting had been in the planning stages for several weeks as aides worked out the particulars. China had pushed for the more relaxed atmosphere of a meeting at Mr. Trump’s resort, rather than at the White House, American officials said.
The leaders will have a full agenda as they hash out some of the more contentious issues in bilateral relations: Mr. Trump’s claims about China’s unfair trade practices; curbing North Korea’s nuclear ambitions; and American concerns about Chinese military ambitions in the South China Sea, among other matters.
The meeting, on April 6 and 7, will follow a recent trip to China by the United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson struck a conciliatory tone as he met Mr. Xi in Beijing on March 19, a visit during which details of the Florida meeting were ironed out.
Mr. Xi will visit Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, after stopping in Finland, said Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
The two leaders had spoken by phone on Feb. 9. During that conversation, Mr. Trump told Mr. Xi he would honor the so-called One China policy, under which the United States recognizes a single Chinese government in Beijing and has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
