On Heels of Typhoon Nesat, a Second Storm Hits Taiwan
HONG KONG — Taiwan was battered Monday by the second large storm in days, in the wake of a typhoon that flooded streets, injured scores of people and forced more than 10,000 to flee their homes.
Tropical Storm Haitang struck Monday on the heels of Typhoon Nesat, which made landfall on Taiwan’s northeastern coast on Saturday. With gusts over 100 miles per hour, Nesat sent trees crashing into cars, toppled motorbikes and kicked up broken glass and other debris that caused injuries, the authorities said.
No deaths had been reported as of Monday, which the authorities attributed to early warnings and evacuations that began on Friday. But the government said more than 100 people were injured by Nesat, many of them rescue workers who were struck by debris. One man in Yilan County, on the northeastern coast, was injured when a utility truck flipped.
By Monday, more than 100 people remained trapped by floodwaters, mostly in the country’s southern counties, according to the government’s Central Weather Bureau.
More than 400 flights have been canceled since Saturday, and more than half a million people were without electricity Monday, according to statistics published by the Central Disaster Emergency Operation Center.
After passing over Taiwan, Typhoon Nesat made landfall in mainland China on Sunday. More than 70,000 people were evacuated from the southeastern province of Fujian, according to news reports.
The authorities in Taiwan warned that the heavy rains increased the risk of landslides, urging residents to beware of “falling rocks, mudslides and flash floods.”
The deadliest typhoon to strike Taiwan in the past decade was Typhoon Morakot, which set off landslides in 2009 that left nearly 700 people dead.
