50 Die After Accident and Fire in Democratic Republic of Congo
NAIROBI, Kenya — At least 50 people were killed and more than 100 suffered burns in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday when a tanker truck collided with a bus and caught fire, officials said.
The fire broke out just as local residents had reached the scene to gather leaking fuel, lifting the number of casualties. The accident occurred near the eastern city of Kisantu, about 125 miles south of the capital, Kinshasa.
