UNITED NATIONS — Out of 193 countries in the world, how many are headed by women?
Just 16 women are heads of state or government worldwide, including those who occupy largely ceremonial posts, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and United Nations Women. The numbers, observers say, are not improving.
The data follows the defeat of Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated as the presidential candidate of a major party in the United States, and the removal from office of two presidents in two traditionally patriarchal societies: Park Geun-hye in South Korea and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil.
Some of the world’s most powerful countries are led by women who span the political spectrum, including Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Marine Le Pen is vying to become president of France, as the leader of a far-right party.
There are increasingly more women represented in the world’s parliaments, often in unexpected places. Women occupy two-thirds of the seats in Rwanda’s Parliament, a higher percentage than in any other country.
The United States lags far behind. As of Jan. 1, 2017, women made up about 19 percent of both houses of Congress. That’s lower than Argentina (39 percent) and Somalia (24 percent).
Over all, the representation of women has barely increased in the past two years. At this rate, the lawmakers’ union chief said, it would take an additional 50 years to reach parity. “There is progress, but progress is excruciatingly slow,” said Martin Chungong, head of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
Here are the 16 leaders included in the report.
• Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh
• Michelle Bachelet, Chile

• Angela Merkel, Germany
