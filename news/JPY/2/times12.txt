South Korea Illegally Held Prostitutes Who Catered to G.I.s Decades Ago, Court Says
SEOUL, South Korea — In a landmark ruling, a South Korean court said on Friday that the government had broken the law during the 1960s and ’70s by detaining prostitutes who catered to American soldiers, and by forcing them to undergo treatment for venereal diseases.
Dozens of former prostitutes brought a lawsuit to press the government to admit that it had played a hand in creating and managing  a vast network of prostitution in camp towns, called gijichon, where poor Korean women worked in bars and brothels frequented by American troops.
