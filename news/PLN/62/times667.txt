Poland's PM Hopes Economy Will Shrink by Less Than 4% This Year
WARSAW â€” The Polish economy could shrink by less than 4% this year, while the unemployment rate will likely remain below 10%, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday.
Poland has announced a rescue package worth over 300 billion zlotys ($76 billion) to help its economy survive the coronavirus crisis. 
"I have a serious not only hope but also macro basis to believe that (the unemployment rate) will not be double-digit, and even that it will be lower than economists had expected a month ago," Morawiecki told RMF radio. 
"The fall in GDP expected by most financial institutions is 4%. I hope it will be lower than forecasts," he also said.
