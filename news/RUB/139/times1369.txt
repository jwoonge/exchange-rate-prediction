Top Opposition Activists Are Arrested in Moscow After Wave of Protests
MOSCOW — A Russian lawyer in the forefront of recent street protests in Moscow was arrested Monday evening in the Russian capital, along with a second opposition activist and an elected local councilor in what appeared to be a sweep by the authorities of protest leaders not already in detention.
The arrests in Moscow targeted Lyubov Sobol, a 31-year-old lawyer who works for Russia’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, an independent group led by Aleksei A. Navalny, another anti-corruption campaigner; Nikolai Lyaskin; and Ilya Azar, a journalist with Novaya Gazeta, an independent daily newspaper, and a local councilor.
Ms. Sobol, the most prominent of the activists known to have been picked up on Monday, has been one of the main public faces of a recent wave of protests, including a peaceful march attended by several thousand people that she led on Saturday through the center of Moscow.
Released from provisional arrest after midnight pending a court hearing, Ms. Sobol said on her Twitter account after her release that she had been picked up by police officers as she was leaving a store and accused of taking part in an illegal gathering.
Accusing Moscow’s mayor, Sergei S. Sobyanin, of “trying to frighten me with night arrests,” she said, “I am not afraid and will continue to work against corrupt officials, falsifiers and scoundrels.”
