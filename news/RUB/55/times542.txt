Victory in Russia Election Assured, Putin Seeks High Turnout
MOSCOW — Browse Vladimir V. Putin’s presidential election website and you will find eight or so organizations pushing his candidacy. With names like I Really Like Putin! and For Putin! and Putin Team, they are among a battery of attempts to generate buzz around a campaign low in surprises.
Having felled any serious competition, Mr. Putin is basically running against himself, political analysts say, but he still faces one threat he cannot easily vanquish: voter indifference.
For Mr. Putin, the March 18 vote is all about turnout as the key barometer of support. Given that existing term limits could make this his last presidential election, Kremlin officials want a victory lap that can be sold at home and abroad as a resounding affirmation of his rule, not to mention of any steps that Mr. Putin, 65, might take to retain power.
But Mr. Putin’s numbers are dragging, analysts say. The problem for the Kremlin is how to generate excitement in a lifeless campaign with a preordained outcome and a candidate who finds campaigning distasteful and the idea of a presidential debate unthinkable.
Broadly speaking, analysts say, a Kremlin that frequently denigrates democracy as a Western import incompatible with Russian traditions is seeking the legitimacy of an election without a real campaign or freely chosen candidates who might electrify voters.
