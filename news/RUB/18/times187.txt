Syria Rejects U.N. Monitoring Role in ‘De-Escalation Zones’
The Syrian government said on Monday that the “de-escalation zones” negotiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey, which took effect this weekend, could not be monitored by others, including the United Nations.

“Moscow has invested all of its cards in the Astana process,” Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said in a briefing posted on the institute’s website. “Russia has a great deal to lose should this initiative fall apart, which makes acquiring a more committed U.S. statement of support extremely important.”
The State Department has expressed concern about the role of Iran in the agreement and the history of failed cease-fires in the war, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and left m
