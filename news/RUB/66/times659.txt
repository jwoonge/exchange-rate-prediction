7 Takeaways From the Airstrikes on Syria
LONDON — The United States, in coordination with France and Britain, carried out a series of predawn airstrikes on Saturday in Syria in response to what it said was a chemical weapons attack this month in the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma.
The strikes were the latest development in a long-running and complex conflict with consequences far beyond Syria itself — including in the United States, Iran, Russia and other parts of Europe.

Here are seven takeaways from the airstrikes and their aftermath:
The United States and its allies tried to walk a fine line with the airstrikes, sending a strong message to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria without provoking a military response from Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad’s two strongest allies.
The operation on Saturday was more powerful than an airstrike ordered by President Trump last year; this time there were three targets, rather than one, requiring twice as many weapons. But it was limited to one night, at least for the moment, was specifically aimed at chemical weapons facilities and steered clear of Russian soldiers and bases.
“Right now this is a one-time shot, and I believe it has sent a very strong message to dissuade him, to deter him from doing it again,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said of Mr. Assad, although Mr. Trump suggested there might be more to come. “We are prepared to sustain this response,” he said, until Syria abandons its use of chemical weapons.
