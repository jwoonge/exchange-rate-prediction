What Happened at the U.N. General Assembly
The live briefing has ended for the day.
You can read more on President Trump’s speech here.
And you can read about the turmoil in Britain for Boris Johnson here.

President Trump was surrounded by like-minded company when the speeches began in the cavernous General Assembly hall on Manhattan’s East Side. He was preceded by President Jair M. Bolsonaro of Brazil, sometimes called the mini-Trump, a polarizing figure at home who, like Mr. Trump, dismisses fears about climate change and disparages critics on Twitter. 
After Mr. Trump came President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the former general who has come to symbolize the repression of the Arab Spring revolutions — although his appearance was thrown into doubt this past weekend as protests erupted at home. He was followed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, an autocrat who has bullied critics and whose government is a leading jailer of journalists. 
Twenty-one leaders were scheduled to speak on Tuesday alone. The final one scheduled is Boris Johnson, making his United Nations debut as Britain’s prime minister. His visit came as the country’s top court delivered a stinging rebuke to Mr. Johnson, ruling he had acted unconstitutionally in suspending Parliament, an action taken as he tries to take his country out of the European Union by Oct. 31.
