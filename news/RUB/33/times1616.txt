Russians Arrested on Treason Charges Helped U.S. Catch Hacker, Report Says
MOSCOW — In December, Russia arrested two of its most senior cybersecurity officials on treason charges, prompting speculation that the pair might have tipped off the American authorities about Russian hacking during the 2016 election campaign.
Prosecutors have released no details since, and the case remains shrouded in mystery.

In December, for example, the Obama administration imposed sanctions for election meddling against two Russian hackers who were already wanted by the F.B.I. for online fraud.
The pair detained in December were high-ranking employees of the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the K.G.B.: Sergei Mikhailov, a deputy director of the agency’s computer crime department, the Center for Information Security, and his aide, Dmitri A. Dokuchaev.
In its report on Wednesday, Dozhd cited sources within the F.S.B., whom it did not identify, saying the treason arrests sprang from helping
