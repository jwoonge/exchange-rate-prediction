Muslim Rights Activist Sentenced to 4 Years in Russia on Disputed Drug Charge
MOSCOW — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a Muslim human rights activist to four years in a penal colony on drug possession charges widely seen as manufactured to further a crackdown on dissent in the Chechnya region.
The activist, Oyub Titiev, 61, had worked for years investigating allegations of abuse ranging from torture to murder under the increasingly autocratic rule of the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov.
Mr. Kadyrov publicly called Mr. Titiev a junkie after his arrest in January 2018.
“Drug addicts were arrested in Chechnya by the thousands, and no one came to their defense,” Mr. Kadyrov said on Chechen television at the time. But as soon as Mr. Titiev was arrested, he complained, “the entire world rose up.”
The organization where Mr. Titiev worked, a local branch of the Memorial Human Rights Center, was placed on a Russian government registry of “foreign agents” in 2014.
Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, said in a statement after the sentencing that she was dismayed by the court’s action.
The accusations against Mr. Titiev, she said, “lacked credibility” from the outset, and his conviction “is but the latest example of the hostile and dangerous environment in which human rights defenders operate in the Chechen Republic.”
Mr. Titiev took over the running of Memorial in Chechnya, in the North Caucasus, after his colleague Natalya Estemirova, a persistent critic of Mr. Kadyrov’s, was kidnapped and then found dead in 2009.
