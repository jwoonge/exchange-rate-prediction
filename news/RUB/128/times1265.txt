U.S.-Iran Crisis Updates  Trump Says Military Was Ready to Strike
In a series of tweets posted Friday morning, Mr. Trump said that American forces were “cocked and loaded” to strike three targets in Iran, but that he had called off the military action with 10 minutes to spare.
He added that he was “in no hurry” to attack Iran. “Our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go,” he said.
Mr. Trump also called the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated during the Obama administration a “desperate and terrible deal.”
Mr. Trump offered a more detailed version of events later in the day, telling NBC’s Chuck Todd, the host of “Meet the Press,” that he had not given a final go-ahead when military officials checked with him a half-hour before the strikes were scheduled to launch.
“So they came and they said, ‘Sir, we’re ready to go. We’d like a decision.’ I said, ‘I want to know something before you go. How many people will be killed, in this case Iranians?’ ” Mr. Trump told Mr. Todd. 
The president said that the officials said they needed to get back to him, but eventually said that “approximately 150” Iranians might die.
Mr. Trump challenged reports that planes were already in the air when he called off the strike, adding: “I didn’t think it was proportionate.”
The United States has requested a closed meeting of the 15-member United Nations Security Council on Monday afternoon to discuss the tensions with Iran. The office of Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi, Kuwait’s ambassador to the United Nations and the president of the Council this month, confirmed that the Americans had requested the meeting. 
Diplomats said it was expected that the United States would present what the Trump administration has described as irrefutable evidence that the surveillance drone was operating in international airspace when Iran targeted it.
