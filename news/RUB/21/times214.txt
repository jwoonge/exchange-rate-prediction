Ex-British Party Leader Is Pulled Into Trump Campaign Inquiry
LONDON — Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, ridiculed a published report on Thursday that suggests United States investigators think he may be able to shed light on any possible collusion between Russia and Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.
Mr. Farage was responding to an article in The Guardian newspaper on Thursday that said he was a “person of interest” in the F.B.I.’s investigation into Moscow’s contacts with representatives of Mr. Trump’s campaign, including Michael T.

The Guardian, citing unidentified sources, said Mr. Farage was not accused of wrongdoing but had “raised the interest” of the F.B.I. because of his relationships with the Trump campaign and with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks.
American officials say Russian hackers working for the government obtained documents from the Democratic Party and provided them to WikiLeaks to damage the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Under Mr. Farage, the far-right, anti-immigrant UKIP played an influential role in a referendum last year in which British voters supported withdrawing from the European Union, commonly known as Brexit.
The investigators are examining whether Mr. Farage was a link between Mr. Assange and Trump advisers including Roger Stone, who has acknowledged being in contact with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who is thought to be an agent of Russian military intelligence.
“This hysterical attempt to associate me with the Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and the election of President Trump,” Mr. Farage said in a statement to The New York Times.
