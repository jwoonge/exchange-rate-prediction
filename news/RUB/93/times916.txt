Macedonia Moves Ahead With Name Change, Helping Its NATO Bid
The government of Macedonia secured just enough support from Parliament late Friday to keep alive a deal to change the country’s name, a move that could end a bitter, decades-old dispute with Greece and set the Balkan nation on a path to joining NATO.
Parliament voted by the slimmest of margins to alter the Constitution to rename the country as the Republic of North Macedonia, giving a tenuous victory to the government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his Western allies.
Eighty members of Parliament voted in favor of the measure — barely meeting the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional changes — after a week of contentious talks that culminated in 12 hours of intense negotiations on Friday.
The move by Parliament came even though a referendum last month failed to attract sufficient turnout to endorse the name change.
“Our journey toward a better future, toward E.U. and NATO membership has just begun,” Mr. Zaev said after the vote, though he acknowledged much work awaited.
Indeed, the path ahead remains complicated and the end result far from certain.
Lawmakers now have 30 days to prepare amendments to the Constitution, and those must pass before the agreement can be taken up in the Greek Parliament, where significant opposition would have to be overcome. Just this week, the Greek foreign minister resigned as members of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s fragile governing coalition fought over the deal.
The  dispute about Macedonia’s name stretches back to 1991, when Macedonia declared independence as the former republic of Yugoslavia broke apart.
Greece refused to recognize the newly formed nation, viewing its decision to call itself Macedonia as a thinly veiled claim on territory in northern Greece, including the strategically important port of Thessaloniki.
