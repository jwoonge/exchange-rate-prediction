Clinton Envy, Mandela and a Horse  Glimpses From the U.K. Archives
LONDON — Every year, the British public gains access to declassified cables and sensitive memos from the top tiers of the government: glimpses of diplomatic outposts around the world, ministers’ thoughts scribbled in margins, and disputes between famous leaders, released by the country’s National Archives.
And sometimes, the public gets to see notes about a horse.
The National Archives on Friday released a new batch of documents, mostly from 1994, that tell of internet anxiety at the prime minister’s office, Margaret Thatcher’s thoughts of Nelson Mandela and the journey of a stallion from Turkmenistan to London.
Not all the files were immediately available online, but most were reviewed by journalists earlier this month.
The National Archives keeps these files under lock and key and releases them periodically, as their confidential status expires. Here’s some of this year’s trove:
In 1994, internal memos advocated that 10 Downing Street embrace the internet, to bring the prime minister up to speed with President Bill Clinton’s White House, which was already posting public announcements online.
“Connecting No. 10 with the internet would keep us up with the White House, which has made a big thing of the modern way the Clinton/Gore administration deals with communications,” wrote a government official, Damian Green, to the private secretary of Prime Minister John Major, according to The Guardian.
“Internet users will be a growing group of opinion-formers, and I can just imagine Tony Blair showing how he belongs to a new generation by signing up,” Mr. Green wrote, referring to the young leader of the opposition — who took over the government in the next election.
Mr. Green, recently an important aide to the current prime minister, Theresa May, was dismissed in 2017 after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his work computer.
