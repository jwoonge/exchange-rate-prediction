Japan Executes Cult Leader Behind 1995 Sarin Gas Subway Attack
The leader of a cult in Japan whose followers released deadly gas in the Tokyo subway in 1995, killing 13 people and injuring thousands, was executed Friday.
The cult leader, Shoko Asahara, was one of 13 people sentenced to death in connection with the attack and other killings carried out by the group, Aum Shinrikyo. He was hanged Friday morning along with six followers, Japan’s Justice Ministry said.
Japan, which generally reserves capital punishment for people convicted of multiple homicides, usually executes a handful of people each year. The date of executions is not announced in advance, and the condemned are usually only told a few hours beforehand.
But the executions of Mr. Asahara and his followers had been expected since January, when Japan’s Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the last member of Aum Shinrikyo to stand trial.
Members of the cult carried bags of sarin gas onto five crowded trains on three subway
