Want to Relax? Try the Spa in a Salt Mine in Belarus
SALIHORSK, Belarus — Yury Lukashenia, a 40-year-old manager in an Austrian company in Belarus, a country often described as Europe’s last dictatorship, earns enough money to take his family on regular holiday getaways to sunny places like Spain and Greece.
But the trip he really looks forward to each spring is a two- or, if he is really lucky, three-week stint in a Belarus salt mine in Salihorsk.
“Of course, the first time, it was a little scary,” he said, recalling his debut journey on a rickety, unlit elevator that rattled 460 yards underground into a dimly lit warren of caves and tunnels gouged from one of the world’s biggest deposits of salt and potassium.
But now on his sixth trip to Salihorsk, the jewel of the former Soviet Union’s salt mining industry, Mr. Lukashenia, who suffers from allergies that make it difficult to breath, said he wouldn’t miss his annual trek for anything.
“I feel better as soon as I get here,” he said. “It is much better to spend two or three weeks in a salt mine than sitting on a yacht.”
He has tried getting his wife to join him but she suffers from claustrophobia so is not interested. She prefers a sunny beach to a dark hole in the ground.
Nor are any of his friends eager to tag along.
“When I tell my friends I’m going to the salt mines, they always ask: ‘What did you do wrong?’”
In Belarus and across the former Soviet Union, the suggestion of a visit to the salt mines generally evokes grim memories of prison camps.
