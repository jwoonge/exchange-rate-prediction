Austria Chancellor Faces Prospect of No-Confidence Vote as Coalition Unravels
VIENNA — Austria’s president praised the “elegance” of the country’s Constitution on Tuesday, seeking to calm concerns as the crisis that has torn apart Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s right-wing coalition government accelerated, putting his future in doubt.
Mr. Kurz, who had sought an early election in September and is preparing to lead a minority government until then, now faces the prospect of a no-confidence vote that could eject him from power within days. A technocratic administration would then take over until elections could be scheduled, probably in June or early July.
The governing coalition, an alliance between Mr. Kurz’s conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party, began to unravel on Saturday, when a video emerged showing the far-right party’s leader discussing an exchange of favors with a woman claiming to be a Russian oligarch’s niece.
The days since have seen the once stable country rocked by political turmoil that could spell disaster for the ambitious young chancellor, once hailed as a rising star of Europe’s conservatives.
The Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, resigned as vice chancellor on Saturday, and Mr. Kurz called for early elections the same day. On Monday, he then called for the firing of the Freedom Party interi
