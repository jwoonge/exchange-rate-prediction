Moldova Has a New Government. The Old One Is Refusing to Leave.
CHISINAU, Moldova — On Friday, Natalia Gavrilita was a director at an aid group in London. On Saturday, she was unexpectedly named minister of finance in her native Moldova. On Monday, she flew home to start her new job.
There’s just one hitch: Her predecessor won’t leave, and the police won’t let her enter her office.
Such are the competing realities in Moldova, a small former Soviet state in southeast Europe, where two of the country’s three largest parties formed a new coalition government on Saturday in order to oust the third from power. But the latter, the Democratic Party of Moldova, has refused to leave office — leaving the country with two claimants to every ministry.
“We have two parallel stories,” said Dumitru Alaiba, a lawmaker from one of the two parties forming the would-be new government. “We have a former prime minister who is refusing to leave.”
The chaos has been compounded by the Constitutional Court, staffed in part by longtime associates of the Democratic Party leader, the oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc.
The court suddenly ruled last weekend that the new government was unconstitutional, on the basis that it was formed more than 90 days after parliamentary elections in February. The court also suspended the Moldovan president and replaced him with the former prime minister, Pavel Filip, who dissolved Parliament and called for new elections in September.
The impasse appeared set to continue into Tuesday, with lawmakers from the two parties trying to form a new government — Now Platform, a pro-European alliance, and the Socialists, a center-left party that leans toward Russia — promising to gather in Parliament in defiance of Mr. Filip and the Constitutional Court.
