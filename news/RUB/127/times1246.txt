Looking for Free Speech in Russia? Try YouTube
MOSCOW — Mainstream television in Russia, stage-managed by the Kremlin, barely mentions Pussy Riot, the anti-Putin punk band, or Aleksei A. Navalny, the country’s most prominent opposition figure. Forget about hearing much feminist talk, or humor at the expense of the government or Russia itself.
“The entire social, political part of television is controlled by the authorities,” said Leonid G. Parfenov, an independent news anchor who has been shut out of state TV since 2004 for being too critical of the government. “For that reason, you cannot consider this television journalism — it is just propaganda, they are just employees of the presidential administration.”
Yet voices that the government would mute are heard regularly by tens of millions of Russians in another format: YouTube.
For more freewheeling opinions and commentary — particularly from those critical of President Vladimir V. Putin — YouTube has become the leading way to reach Russian audiences. In particular, it is challenging — if not supplanting — state TV as a source of information for the young.
Pussy Riot earned an international reputation for a guerrilla performance in a Moscow cathedral that landed its members in prison. But the band’s critiques of Mr. Putin and — worse, for many Russians — its reputation for sacrilege and denigration of the Motherland have ensured that it remained all but invisible on state media.
