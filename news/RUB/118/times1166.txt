Julian Assange’s Seven Strange Years in Self-Imposed Isolation
The spectacle of Julian Assange, bearded and haggard, resisting arrest while London police officers dragged him through the street, punctuated the end of seven confounding years inside the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he lived with his cat in a small corner room as the world’s most famous self-proclaimed political refugee.
Mr. Assange, 47, has long fashioned himself as a crusader for revealing secrets. The internet group he founded, WikiLeaks, published caches of classified American government communications, as well as emails hacked by Russian intelligence clearly intended to damage the presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton.
Though arrested Thursday morning by the British for skipping bail, Mr. Assange was immediately charged in the United States for conspiracy to hack a government computer.
To supporters, Mr. Assange was a martyr and champion of free speech. To the United States government, he was a pariah and a  lackey of the Kremlin. But it was the hardened opinion of Ecuador’s government that perhaps mattered most.
He had become an unwanted houseguest.
At the tiny red-brick embassy, he continued to run his internet group, conducted news conferences before hundreds of fawning admirers from a balcony, rode his skateboard in the halls, and played host to a parade of visitors, including Lady Gaga and Pamela Anderson, a rumored lover who brought vegan sandwiches.
On Thursday, Ms. Anderson sent out a batch of Twitter messages attacking the arrest as a “vile injustice” and called Britain and the United States “devils and liars and thieves.”
