Malcolm Turnbull, Australian Leader, Pokes Fun at Trump in Leaked Recording
SYDNEY, Australia — Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s first phone call with President Trump was famously unpleasant. His next one might be even more so.
On Thursday, an Australian news network released a brief recording of Mr. Turnbull poking fun at the president, at a dinner full of journalists that was supposed to be off the record.
“The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls,” said Mr. Turnbull (whose actual poll numbers, like Mr. Trump’s, are nothing to boast about). “We are winning so much. We are winning like we have never won before.”
