Russian Professor, Found With Bag of Severed Arms, Admits He Killed Student
MOSCOW — Oleg Sokolov, a Russian historian who made a career studying and impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte, liked to be called “Sire.” He also had a long history of seducing and being violent toward female students at a prestigious  university.
“He thought he could do anything and looked down on the world around him as if he really were Napoleon,” said Lydia Nevzorova, the wife of a prominent Russian television personality who met Mr. Sokolov socially in St. Petersburg, Russia’s imperial-era capital.
On Monday, however, the once haughty Mr. Sokolov, 63, sobbed uncontrollably as he appeared in a St. Petersburg court to express “deep repentance” for killing and dismembering his 24-year-old student and lover, Anastasia Yeshchenko. “I am devastated,” he said.
On Saturday, Mr. Sokolov was fished out of the frigid Moika River in St. Petersburg
