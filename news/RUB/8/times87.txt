Ukraine ‘Blockaders’ Try to Cut Off Rail Traffic From Rebel Areas
KIEV, Ukraine — The scene, captured on video Tuesday, appears like something post-apocalyptic, right down to the decrepit-looking freight train in the background.
Unidentified men carrying clubs attack a group of men who seem to have commandeered the freight train, and a fight ensues with sticks, hurled stones and a buzzing chain saw. The defenders of the train are getting the worst of it until an armed man arrives on the scene and fires a warning shot into the air, scattering the attackers.
Tensions are rising along the border between Ukraine and the breakaway “republics” in the eastern part of the country as Ukrainian nationalists from the western part seek to choke off all railroad traffic in what they are calling a blockade.
The war in eastern Ukraine, now entering its third year, has been the bloodiest in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s.
