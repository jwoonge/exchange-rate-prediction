Defense Secretary Mattis Tells NATO Allies to Spend More, or Else
BRUSSELS — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, echoing his boss in Washington, warned on Wednesday that the amount of American support for NATO could depend on whether other countries meet their own spending commitments.
“Americans cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do,” Mr. Mattis said in his first speech to NATO allies since becoming defense secretary. “I owe it to you to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States and to state the fair demand from my country’s people in concrete terms.”
“America will meet its responsibilities,” he said, but he made clear that American support had its limits.
In his speech to NATO defense ministers, Mr. Mattis repeated a call made by previous American secretaries of defense, for European allies to spend more on their militaries. His comments on Wednesday give teeth to President Trump’s expressed skepticism about the alliance.
What’s more, Mr. Mattis went further than his predecessors in apparently linking American contributions to the alliance to what other countries spend.
“If your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defense,” he said.
Mr. Mattis did not say how the United States might back away from its obligations to NATO members, though there are several steps the Trump administration could take short of refusing to come to the aid of an ally under attack. That would be an abrogation of its treaty responsibilities, but the United States could reduce the number of American troops stationed in certain European countries or raise the bar for what it considers a military attack.
The United States spends more of its gross domestic product on the military than any other NATO member — 3.61 percent, or $664 billion in 2016. NATO countries have committed to spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on the military, but the only other countries that meet that criteria are Britain, Poland, Estonia and Greece.
During his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis called for the adoption of a plan with fixed dates to make progress toward getting to 2 percent.
For decades, the United States has exhorted its allies to put more money into their military budgets, arguing that if the alliance is called on to defend a member country, the United States would have to shoulder too much of the load. But European governments have different priorities when it comes to military spending than the United States. Iceland, for instance, has no military. And Germany, which since the end of World War II has rejected military force outside self-defense, spends only 1.2 percent of its G.D.P. on the military.
European Union budgetary rules also constrain some NATO countries from increasing their budget deficits.
Martin Stropnicky, the Czech Republic’s defense minister, said in an interview that Mr. Mattis’s speech was not a surprise, and he did not view it as a threat. “He was absolutely calm and humble and modest,” Mr. Stropnicky said, adding that his government had increased its military spending. But the Czech Republic still spends just over 1 percent of its G.D.P. on its military, according to NATO.
Mr. Trump is expected to visit NATO headquarters in May when the alliance holds its leaders’ summit meeting.
This meeting in Brussels was a tough European debut for the Trump administration, as Mr. Mattis also sought to convince NATO allies that the United States still values the alliance despite the president’s persistent critiques.
The latest disclosures, that members of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and other confidants had communicated with Russia intelligence officers, and the resignation of Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, for misleading statements about his telephone conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak, raised allies’ anxiety.
Privately and publicly, a number of top NATO officials expressed concern about Russian meddling in elections in Europe and the United States. And they hung on Mr. Mattis’s every word on Wednesday, listening for clues to understand what the complex entanglements between Trump administration officials and Russian intelligence officers might mean for the trans-Atlantic alliance as it tries to confront a menacing and more aggressive Moscow.
Mr. Mattis sought to persuade the United States’ allies that nothing has changed when it comes to countering President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia. He said Mr. Flynn’s exit over his communications with Russia’s ambassador would not change his message to NATO. “Frankly this has no impact,” he said aboard his flight to Brussels. “No effect at all.”
But Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the Dutch minister of defense, was pointed. “There’s no such thing as business as usual with Russia,” she said on Wednesday before the meeting.
One NATO official characterized the mood in the heavily fortified compound as tense and said allies were waiting to see if the message Mr. Mattis presented on Wednesday differed in tone from what Mr. Trump has said.
In one important way, the defense secretary amplified the president’s previous statements. Though Mr. Mattis acknowledged “concern in European capitals about America’s commitment to NATO and the security of Europe,” he said allies must do more to reach their commitments to spend 2 percent of their G.D.P. on their militaries. “No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of western values,” he said.
Mr. Mattis also struck an assertive tone on Russia, saying the 2014 annexation of Crimea dashed any hopes that NATO could have a real partnership with Russia.
“Events of 2014 were sobering,” he said in opening remarks made alongside the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. He added, “As President Trump has stated, he has strong support for NATO.”
But many officials here remained unconvinced, privately citing Mr. Trump’s previous statements calling the alliance “obsolete” and complaining that it had not “bothered” about terrorism. Last year, he suggested that American support for members of the alliance might be conditional on whether those members paid their financial share.
Mr. Trump’s remarks have deeply rattled NATO’s Eastern European members in particular. But his comments may have spurred a new focus on the alliance’s spending. “The U.S. has made clear that we need more defense spending and fairer burden-sharing,” Mr. Stoltenberg said on Wednesday. He pointed to numbers released a day earlier that showed that military spending among European NATO countries and Canada had increased 3.8 percent in 2016 — around $10 billion.
“This is significant, but not enough,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “We have to continue to increase military spending across Europe and Canada.”
Separately, Mr. Stoltenberg expressed concern over news that Russia had deployed a new cruise missile that American officials say violates a landmark arms control treaty. The ground-launched cruise missile is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land.
The Obama administration tried to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase, but instead, the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit. “Any noncompliance of Russia with the I.N.F. treaty would be a serious concern for the alliance,” Mr. Stoltenberg said.
