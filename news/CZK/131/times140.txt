Violent Thunderstorms Kill at Least 7 in Northern Greece
At least seven people died and more than 100 were injured after intense thunderstorms hit northern Greece, tearing out tall pine trees and destroying houses in their passing, officials said on Thursday.
The area affected, Halkidiki, is a peninsula with sandy beaches that is popular with tourists. Thessaloniki, the second-biggest city in Greece, is just to the north.
Kostas Pahinis, fire brigade commander for Central Macedonia, the region that includes Halkidiki, said by phone on Thursday that the storms had been so severe that a kind of tornado had developed.
“It is the first time this has happened to us,” Mr. Pahinis said. “It ripped out more than 500 trees,” he added.
The fire service said that a warning about winds and rain had been issued but that the intensity of the storms had been totally unexpected.
Six of those who died were foreign nationals, Mr. Pahinis said, with the count of those injured at 102.
At about 10 p.m. Wednesday, residents and vacationers were forced to seek cover when a strong wind began blowing across the region, carrying away beach umbrellas and aluminum roofs. The sudden change came as a surprise to many, after several days of clear, hot weather.
An older Czech couple died when the wind blew away their camping trailer, while a 54-year-old Romanian woman and her 8-year-old son were killed on the beach after the roof of a nearby taverna collapsed in Nea Plagia, a small, seaside area in the western part of Halkidiki, according to fire brigade officials.
