Czech Coal Mine Explosion Kills at Least 13
WARSAW — An explosion in a coal mine in the Czech Republic killed at least 13 people on Thursday, the nation’s deadliest mining disaster in nearly three decades.
The blast, caused by methane gas igniting, devastated large portions of a hard-coal mine near Karvina, a small city on the border with Poland, according to the state-run OKD mining company.
The number of people injured and the extent of the damage were not immediately clear, with rescue workers struggling to reach the site of the blast, more than half a mile underground, because of flames and smoke, according to company officials speaking on Czech television.
“Due to yesterday’s mine disaster, 13 miners lost their lives,” a company spokesman, Ivo Celechovsky, said at a news conference. Twelve of the dead miners were Poles, and one was Czech.
Boleslav Kowalczyk, the company’s managing director, said the search of the scene had to be abandoned because of conditions in the shaft.
“Unfortunately, we have reached a point where it was impossible to move forward, because there was a fire raging and zero visibility,” he said.
According to the company, it was the deadliest coal mining disaster in the country since an accident in 1990 that killed 30 people.
The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said he would travel to the mine, in the far eastern part of the Czech Republic, where he would join his Czech counterpart, Andrej Babis.
“I wish to express words of deepest sympathy to all the close victims of the mining disaster in Karvina,” Mr. Morawiecki said. “This is a huge tragedy for all Poles and Czechs. On this difficult day, we strongly show our solidarity and sense of national community.”
The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, also expressed his condolences on Twitter, saying, “O Lord, keep the families of the miners in your care. R.I.P.”
