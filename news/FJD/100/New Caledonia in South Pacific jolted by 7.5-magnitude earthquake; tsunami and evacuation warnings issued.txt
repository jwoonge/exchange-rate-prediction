   Tsunami warnings and a full evacuation from coastal areas were issued in New Caledonia, a French territory in the South Pacific, after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck just off the coast. 
   Three- to 10-foot waves were possible in New Caledonia and Vanuatu, with smaller ones potentially reaching Fiji. The New Caledonian high commission issued a tsunami warning for all of New Caledonia, ordering residents to evacuate to refuge areas immediately—away from the coast and higher than 12 meters—and to put safety protocols in motion, reported The Guardian. 
   “If you don’t have time to prepare your evacuation, get more than 300m away from the coast and/or get to a height of more than 12m,” warned the Directorate for Civil Protection and Risk Management of New Caledonia (DSCGR), according to The Guardian. 
   The quake hit at around noon on Wednesday.
