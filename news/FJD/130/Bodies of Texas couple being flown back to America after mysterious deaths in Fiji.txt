   The bodies of a Texas couple who died during their Fiji vacation earlier this summer are being transported back to the United States while investigators continue to probe their mysterious deaths. 
   David and Michelle Paul, both from Fort Worth, checked into their hotel on Denaru Island on May 22. Within just a few days however, the pair fell ill with an unidentified sickness that caused them to vomit for hours on end. 
   Both were given anti-nausea medication and fluids, but Michelle later succumbed to the sickness on May 27. Her husband died just two days later. 
   This week, they would’ve been on vacation with family in San Antonio for the 4th of July, but their loved ones instead now must wait for their remains to be flown back from Fiji to the United States, WFAA reported. 
   Michelle’s father, Mark Calanog said the bodies have finally been cleared by the U.S. Embassy, adding that he hopes they’ll be home sometime this week. 
   The Pauls’ family said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Fiji health officials have already ruled out influenza or any infectious diseases, but the couple’s exact causes of death are still unclear. 
   “They have turned their focus to toxins or anything that may have been ingested,” Calanog noted. 
   Authorities said they intend to look further into a video Michelle took of David at a Fiji restaurant in a bid to retrace the couple’s steps and figure out what they ate before they became sick.
