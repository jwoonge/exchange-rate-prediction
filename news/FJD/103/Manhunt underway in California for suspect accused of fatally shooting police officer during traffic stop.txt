   A police officer in California was shot dead during a traffic stop early Wednesday morning — and now authorities are searching for his killer. 
   Newman police officer Ronil Singh called out “shots fired” over his radio around 1 a.m., just minutes after he reported a traffic stop at Merced Street and Eucalyptus Avenue, according to a press release from the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department. 
   Multiple agencies responded to the scene, where they discovered Singh suffering from gunshot wounds. The officer was transported to a local hospital and pronounced dead a short time later. He had worked with the Newman Police Department since July 2011. 
   The suspect managed to flee before responding officers arrived. Authorities have released photos of the unidentified suspect. 
   A gray, extended cab Dodge Ram pickup was one of the last vehicles seen near where the shooting occurred. The truck has paper license plates. 
   Singh, a native of Fiji, studied criminal justice at Modesto Junior College in 2005 and joined the Turlock Police Department a year later. He also worked as a deputy with the Merced County Sheriff’s office in 2010 before joining the Newman Police Department, according to the Sacramento Bee. 
   “Our Newman police department is devastated by the loss of Ronil,” said Newman Police Chief Randy Richardson. 
   “If anyone has any information regarding the identify of the suspect, please contact law enforcement immediately so we can get this cop-killer off the streets." 
   The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information can leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at (209) 521-4636.
