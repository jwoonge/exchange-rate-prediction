   California cops are on a desperate search for a gunman suspected of killing a police officer during a traffic stop early Wednesday morning. 
   After getting pulled over, the suspect fled in his vehicle after shooting Newman police corporal Ronil Singh, 33, said the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department. 
   Singh, a Fiji native, had been a member of the Newman Police Department since 2011, the sheriff’s office said. 
   He previously served with the Merced County Sheriff’s Department, according to a statement from California Gov. Jerry Brown. 
   A statement issued by Newman Police Chief Randy Richardson read, “Our Newman Police family is devastated by the loss of Ronil.” 
   Singh leaves behind his wife and 5-month-old son, according to officials. 
   “Our hearts are with the entire community of Newman and law enforcement officers across the state who risk their lives every day to protect and serve the people of California,” said Brown. 
   Images of the suspect were captured on surveillance video, according to the sheriff’s office. 
   “If anyone has any information regarding the identity of the suspect, please contact law enforcement immediately so we can get this cop killer off the streets,” said Richardson. 
   The suspect’s car, a a gray pickup truck, was located and seized by police Wednesday night, reported TV station KFSN. 
   Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke recalled Singh’s career start in law enforcement. 
   “Tragedy, there’s just no other words to explain this,” said Vern Warnke, the sheriff of Merced County, where Singh began his career. “We are doing what we can but as a law enforcement community, this is just tragic.”
