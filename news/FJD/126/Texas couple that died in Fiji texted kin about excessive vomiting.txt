   Devastating text messages reveal the final days of a Texas couple before they died in Fiji. 
   From the South Pacific, Michelle Paul messaged family members regarding a mystery illness that ultimately claimed both her life and the life of husband David. 
   ABC News acquired the text massages from relatives which offers insights into the couple’s debilitating conditions and the treatment they were offered by doctors at a clinic. 
   After arriving at the tropical paradise, the two became violently ill but offered no explanation as to what was killing them. 
   “We are both going to doctor now,” texted Michelle Paul, 35, to her parents in Nevada after she and husband David arrived at the vacation hot spot. “We have been throwing up for 8 hours. Dave has diarrhea. My hands are numb. We will text when we can.” 
   The Fiji Health Ministry has been working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to determine the ailment that claimed the seemingly healthy couple, reported ABC News. 
   Back in their hotel room, Michelle Paul wrote another text to mom, Juliet Calanog, updating their status after meeting with health workers. 
   “We just got back from the clinic. They gave us fluids and anti-nausea drip,” wrote Michelle. “They gave us electrolyte packets and anti-nausea pills. We still don’t feel 100%. Going to rest in our room.” 
   But the treatments failed to help them. Michelle died May 25 and David, 37, passed away May 27. 
   The Health Ministry in Fiji said an investigation continues. 
   “Influenza has been ruled out, and at this stage, we do not believe there is a risk to the public,” said the Fiji Ministry of Health on Tuesday. “It would be premature to speculate further on the cause of death until the investigation is complete.”
