   The autopsies from a Texas couple that died from a mystery illness in Fiji are complete, but the woman’s devastated dad still doesn’t know what killed them. 
   Michelle and David Paul of Forth Worth, Texas, were vacationing in the South Pacific when they became gravely ill, and Michelle’s father is frantically waiting for answers. 
   Fiji’s U.S. Embassy told Las Vegas resident Mark Calanog, the father of Michelle, that the autopsy results are pending. He fears an infectious disease might have killed the pair. 
   “I gave them instruction not to do any cremation until I’m satisfied ... because I would like the whole world to know if they died of infectious diseases,” Calanog told ABC News. “The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) can confirm that and tell Americans and other people that these are the issues you’re going to face if you have to travel to Fiji. Be aware.” 
   If an infectious disease is the culprit, their corpses must be cremated. 
   Family members believe the killer was a type of virus virile enough to disable two young, healthy people. 
   “Very physically fit,” the Pauls’ sister-in-law Tracey Calanog told TV station KVUE of David Paul. “Former Air Force. Former student-athlete.” 
   The couple died in May, only days after their arrival on Fiji. They reportedly experienced severe diarrhea, vomiting and extreme weakness. 
   On Monday, a State Department official confirmed the couple’s deaths, but could not explain how they perished. 
   Michelle reportedly died before David. KVUE reported that David was being prepped to be transported to Australia by helicopter for further treatment before succumbing to the sickness, possibly pneumonia. 
   The pair left behind a 2-year-old son and David’s daughter from a previous relationship.
