   Sink your jaws into this. 
   The annual aquatic extravaganza known as Shark Week celebrates its 30th anniversary this summer with a full-to-the-gills lineup of celebs and sea creatures. 
   Airing from July 22-29 on Discovery, this year’s Shark Week boasts more than 19 hours of programming. 
   Highlights will include “Uncaged: Shark vs Ronda Rousey,” an apparent battle of sorts between the WWE Superstar and the Mako shark, which Discovery refers to as “the fastest, bitiest shark in the world.” 
   Rousey, 31, first trains by facing off against more lightweight shark species in Fiji before taking on the Mako in New Zealand.In a playful partnering, “Shark Tank Meets Shark Week” brings the business-themed reality show’s investors — Barbara Corcoran, Mark Cuban, Daymond John, and Kevin O’Leary — along for the ride and pairs them with different oceanic organizations that fight habitat destruction, overfishing, and more. 
   The investors then face off and argue why each of their causes deserves a $50,000 donation. 
   Other Shark Week specials will include “Sharkwrecked,” a reenactment of what happens when a shipwreck occurs in shark infested waters; and “Get Out Alive,” a survival guide for anyone who may encounter the often-frightening fish.
