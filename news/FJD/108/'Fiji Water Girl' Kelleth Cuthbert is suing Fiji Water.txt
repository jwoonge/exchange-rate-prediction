   She’s taking Fiji Water from the red carpet to the courtroom. 
   Kelleth Cuthbert — the model who was dubbed "Fiji Water Girl" for her photo-bombing skills at the Golden Globe Awards — has decided to sue the company that made her famous. 
   Fiji Water Company and The Wonderful Company is now under fire after they “intentionally created cardboard cutouts” of the 31-year-old for a marketing campaign, according to court documents obtained by The Blast. 
   However, Cuthbert, whose real name is Kelly Steinbach, claims the cutouts were taking advantage of her newly unexpected fame. 
   Steinbach is remembered for perfectly photobombing celebrities like Kaley Cuoco, Judy Greer, and Nicole Kidman on the red carpet. 
   She was pressured “into video recording a fake signing of a fake document to simulate Steinbach signing on as a Fiji Water Ambassador,” according to the lawsuit — but the model never agreed to sign anything regarding a marketing campaign. 
   Fiji Water has since spoken out about the lawsuit, which they are calling “frivolous and entirely without merit.” 
   “After the Golden Globes social media moment, we negotiated a generous agreement with Ms. Cuthbert that she blatantly violated. We are confident that we will prevail in Court. Throughout our history, we have had a sterling reputation working with talent,” the company said in a statement.
