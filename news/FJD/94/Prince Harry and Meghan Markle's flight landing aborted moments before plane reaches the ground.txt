   Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s arrival in Australia was briefly delayed Friday as the plane they were riding in was forced to abort its landing. 
   Video of the attempted landing shows the aircraft nearing the runway before quickly beginning to ascend again. 
   The abrupt change in plans occurred because a different plane was on the runway where the pilot had intended to land. 
   "There was an aircraft on the runway a little slow to roll so the decision was taken to abort the landing," an announcement on the plane informed passengers. 
   The incident didn’t set the royal couple back too much, however, as they made their landing in Sydney minutes afterward. 
   Harry and Markle flew into the Australian city from Tonga on Friday, marking the latest stop on their 16-day tour. The four-nation trip — which also includes stops in Fiji and New Zealand — is Harry and Markle’s first tour since marrying in May. 
   Kensington Palace announced earlier this month that Harry and Markle are expecting their first child together.
