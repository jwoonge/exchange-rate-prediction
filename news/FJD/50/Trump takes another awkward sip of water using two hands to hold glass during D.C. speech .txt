   He's making America thirsty again. 
   President Trump was unveiling his new national security strategy in front of military service members in Washington, D.C., on Monday when he took yet another awkward drink of water – but this time using two hands to hold his glass. 
   "On January 20, 2017, I stood on the steps of the capital to herald the day the people became rulers of their nation again," the President said before reaching for the glass to take a sip. 
   In November, he grabbed a bottle of Fiji water and sipped it awkwardly as cameras flashed in the background during a press conference at the White House. 
   That "thirsty" moment echoed that of Sen. Marco Rubio's sip of water during his 2013 State of the Union response. 
   "Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottle — would have much less negative impact," the President tweeted at the time. 
   Social media quickly took notice of Trump's recent cringe-worthy moment. 
   "That's exactly how my 2-year-old nephew drinks from a glass," user @mcnultyruss tweeted. 
   "Who uses two hands to lift a water glass? Really?" user @BeckyConnell6 wrote. 
   "Are his hands too small to hold a glass? Is this why he uses both?" user @Tokenarino wrote. 
   "Can't someone please just get him a sippy cup!!!" user @mark—callaghan1 wrote.
