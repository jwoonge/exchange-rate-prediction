   Matt Bellamy put a ring on it. 
   The Muse front man proposed to model girlfriend Elle Evans in Fiji earlier in December, she announced Saturday. 
   "Just a few days after my birthday, on the most romantic holiday of our lives, the man of my dreams asked me to marry him! After tears of joy, gasps of shock, and a split second of disbelief, of course I said YES!" Evans wrote on Instagram. 
   "I can't imagine our lives apart. What I can imagine is a bright future full of love & light, family & friends, moments that turn into cherished memories, and a lifetime of pure bliss." 
   The couple has been dating for about two years. 
   Bellamy was previously engaged to Kate Hudson, with whom he has a 6-year-old son. 
   He was also engaged to Italian psychologist Gaia Polloni before splitting in 2009.
