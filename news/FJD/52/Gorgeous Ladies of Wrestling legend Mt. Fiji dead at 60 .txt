   Emily Dole, the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling star known best as Mt. Fiji, died Wednesday. 
   She was 60. 
   Dole, one of the biggest stars during GLOW's run from 1986 to 1992, never lost a match during her wrestling career, which included feuds with villains like Matilda the Hun and Big Bad Mama. 
   "Rip Emily Dole ! WE LOST OUR GLOW SISTER THIS MORNING. We are very sad that she passed away," Patricia Summerland, who went by Sunny the California Girl, tweeted. 
   "We are the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. She was the CHAMP IN THE RING. Fly high Mountain Fiji." 
   Although Dole's cause of death is unknown, a 2012 Netflix documentary about the female wrestlers showed her in poor health and in a wheelchair. 
   During her reign, Dole also used her popularity and prowess inside the ring to promote herself outside of GLOW, including appearances on "Regis and Kathie Lee" and "Son in Law." 
   She also likely inspired Britney Young's Carmen (Machu Picchu) Wade on the Netflix show "GLOW," which stars Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin.
