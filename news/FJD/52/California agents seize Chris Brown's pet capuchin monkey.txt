   LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” California fish and wildlife agents have seized Chris Brown's pet monkey from his Los Angeles home. 
   Capt. Patrick Foy says Friday that investigators determined the singer didn't have a permit for the capuchin monkey, named Fiji. 
   The singer posted an Instagram video last month showing his 3-year-old daughter, Royalty, cuddling with the monkey. Foy says that prompted a half-dozen calls to the wildlife department from concerned people. 
   Foy says Brown agreed to cooperate. Agents served a search warrant Jan. 2 at his home. 
   Foy says Brown wasn't there but had employees hand over the monkey in a cage. 
   Fiji is now at an undisclosed facility. 
   Brown could face a misdemeanor charge carrying a potential six-month jail sentence. 
   Email and phone message requests for comment from his representatives weren't immediately returned.
