   Hip-hop star Drake doesn't want a fan who broke into his house to get a rap sheet. 
   The 30-year-old artist won't pursue felony burglary charges against a woman who entered his Hidden Hills, Calif., mansion earlier this month, put on his hoodie and drank some of his soda and water, a source told the Daily News. 
   The "Passionfruit" rapper doesn't want the 24-year-old woman to go to prison because he believes she has mental issues, according to TMZ. 
   His lawyer reportedly told the Los Angeles County District Attorney that Drake won't cooperate if authorities attempt to prosecute the woman, making it likely that she'll walk free. 
   The woman entered Drake's home on April 3 and was found by a member of his crew in one of the rapper's bedrooms. 
   She later admitted to taking Fiji Water, Sprite and Pepsi after police arrived. 
   Drake was not home when the woman was in his home. It's unclear how she got into his house, as there were no signs of forced entry.
