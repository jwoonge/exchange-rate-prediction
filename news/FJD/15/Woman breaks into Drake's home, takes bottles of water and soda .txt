   A female intruder was allegedly caught "Sneakin'" around inside Drake's home â€” but all she pilfered were a few drinks. 
   A member of Drake's team discovered a 24-year-old woman inside one of the rapper's bedrooms on April 3, TMZ reported. She was reportedly wearing one of the rapper's hoodies. 
   Police arrived at the scene, where the woman admitted to taking some Fiji water, Sprite and Pepsi from the rapper's home, according to the gossip website. 
   She apparently didn't swipe anything else besides the drinks, but the woman was still arrested and hit with felony burglary charges, according to TMZ. 
   The woman had told officers that she was given permission to go inside Drake's home, but that reportedly was not the case. 
   There was no evidence of forced entry into the "Passionfruit" artist's residence, and it's unclear how she managed to get inside. 
   It's unclear where the incident occurred. 
   Representatives for Drake have not released any information about the situation, which comes after Drake accused a country club called The Madison Club near Coachella of racial profiling in a since deleted Instagram post. 
   "The most offensive place I have ever stayed at in my life with staff who pick and choose who they are going to accommodate based on racial profiling," Drake captioned the post. 
   Drake made a surprise performance at the Coachella music festival in Indio, Calif., on Saturday, where he performed hits "Fake Love," "Jumpman" and "Gyalchester" during Future's set. 
   Drake is the latest celebrity to have his house broken into in recent months, joining a list that includes Nicki Minaj and Alanis Morissette.
