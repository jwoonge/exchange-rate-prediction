Suicide Bombers Storm TV Station in Afghanistan
JALALABAD, Afghanistan — Suicide bombers besieged the state television offices in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Wednesday, officials said, fighting for three hours and leaving at least six people dead.
The office of the governor of Nangarhar Province, where Jalalabad is, said four attackers had stormed the building. One of the attackers detonated his explosives at the entrance, while the others entered the building and resisted security forces for nearly three hours.
Two of the attackers were killed, and security forces were trying to track down the other two. Mohammad Gulab Mangal, the province’s governor, said four employees of the state television channel and two police officers were killed, and 24 others, including seven police officers, were injured. But Najibullah Kamawal, the provincial health director, put the number of injured at 18.
Witnesses reported multiple loud explosions and continuing gunfire. Video captured by the local news media showed one suspected militant being arrested by Afghan forces.
Hours after the Taliban denied involvement, a regional affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the terror monitor group SITE Intelligence.
Affiliates of the Islamic State are active in the province, using the district of Achin as their stronghold. Afghan security forces, accompanied by American advisers and air power, have been trying to reduce the group’s territory and number of fighters with multiple operations.
Their numbers have shrunk to about 700 fighters, down from the estimated 2,000 to 3,000 in 2016, according to American military officials. But as the group has lost men and territory, it has claimed more urban attacks.
Last month, the United States used its largest conventional weapon, known as “mother of all bombs,” against the group’s cave complex in Achin district.
