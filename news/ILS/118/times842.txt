A Guide to Our Israel Election Coverage
Over the last decade, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly quashed rivals on the left and the right, defying the odds — and the polls — to hold onto power. He has increasingly relied on right-wing partners to do so.
Yet in nationwide elections Tuesday, he faces an unexpectedly strong challenger: Benny Gantz, a former army chief who has tirelessly reminded voters that Mr. Netanyahu may soon face corruption charges — a planned indictment that would make him the first sitting prime minister in Israel to face criminal prosecution.
Mr. Netanyahu’s future — and his legacy — are not the only things at stake in the election. A potential reshuffling of Israel’s chaotic political landscape could have far-reaching consequences. Here’s a guide to our coverage of the players, issues and possible ramifications of the election.
• Mr. Netanyahu, 69, has framed himself as Israel’s Indispensable Man: the tough ex-soldier who has aggressively defended Israel’s interests, raising the country’s prominence on the world stage. His relentless self-promotion and potent politics of division — pitting right against left, Jew against Arab, religious against secular — have helped him dodge past allegations of corruption and build his current coalition, consisting of his Likud party and pro-settlement and ultra-Orthodox factions.
• Mr. Gantz, 59, is a three-star general who fought two wars in Gaza, giving him credentials to challenge Mr. Netanyahu’s “Mr. Security” persona. In campaign ads, Mr. Gantz both boasted about “terrorists killed” over his military career and suggested he could be a peacemaker. He teamed up with two other former army chiefs and another centrist, Yair Lapid, to try to court voters in the middle of the ideological spectrum.
• Under Israel’s chaotic and confusing parliamentary system, a panoply of small parties could tip the balance of power. The unlikeliest kingmaker is an iconoclastic politician, Moshe Feiglin, last seen pushing a far-right agenda of annexing the entire West Bank. He is now calling for the legalization of marijuana and has put out proposals aimed at reducing the cost of living: a flat tax, privatization of hospitals, an end to import tariffs, and land reform to lower housing costs.
• The Arab vote is also a wild card — especially as, on the eve of the election, Mr. Netanyahu pledged to begin annexing parts of the West Bank, a potentially fatal blow to the prospects for a peace agreement with Palestinians. A strong turnout among Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20 percent of the population, could raise the number of votes needed to make it into Parliament, jeopardizing smaller parties on the right and the left. Yet Arab voters have seemed even less enthusiastic about voting than Jews, and a boycott-the-vote campaign has gained strength in the past month.
• Whoever wins in the electoral contest will have to cobble together a coalition in Parliament, where no party has ever won a 61-seat majority outright. Here’s our guide to the factions and system.
• In the turbulent run-up to the vote, parties collapsed, former allies turned on one another and younger Likud leaders prepared for life after Bibi. Election ads reflected the ugly, anything-goes tenor of the race, and neither of the front-runners said much about policy.
• A series of unforced errors by Mr. Gantz gave Mr. Netanyahu opportunities to call his fitness for office into question, as did a report on Israeli television that Mr. Gantz’s cellphone had been hacked by Iranian intelligence. Mr. Netanyahu also played up President Trump’s recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory, and his relationship with Mr. Trump.
• Mr. Gantz, meanwhile, hammered on the allegations of corruption around the prime minister. An Israeli watchdog group found a network of hundreds of social media accounts, many of them fake, were being used to smear Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents. Both men seized on Menachem Begin, the former prime minister and militant Zionist, as a campaign prop — 27 years after his death.
• In February, Israel’s attorney general announced his intention to indict Mr. Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing, and is entitled to a hearing before an indictment is formally issued.

• Mr. Netanyahu is also facing a new scandal: He is accused of secretly approving the sale of advanced submarines to Egypt without the approval of top military officials, and is accused of self-dealing, through an undisclosed and enormously profitable financial stake in a company that supplied the German builder of both the Egyptian subs and several new Israeli warships.
