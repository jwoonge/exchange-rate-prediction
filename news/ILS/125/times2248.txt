Bus With Mexican Catholic Pilgrims Collides With Tractor-Trailer, Killing 21
MEXICO CITY — A fiery freeway accident involving a tractor-trailer and a bus carrying Catholic pilgrims killed 21 people and injured 30 in the Mexican state of Veracruz on Wednesday, according to the authorities and local news outlets.
The accident occurred shortly after 10 a.m. local time on a principal highway between the cities of Puebla and Orizaba.
The bus was en route to the southern state of Chiapas from Mexico City when it collided with the tractor-trailer, flipped over and burst into flames. Photos and videos from the scene showed the crash site engulfed in a giant cloud of smoke and fire.
The bus was carrying members of a Roman Catholic archdiocese located in the city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez in Chiapas.
While the local news media initially reported that the bus’s brakes had failed and that it had slammed into the truck, a spokesman for the Veracruz Secretariat for Civil Protection said late Wednesday that it was allegedly the tractor-trailer’s brakes that had failed, causing the truck to plow into the bus. But the spokesman, Enrique Silva Solís, also said that version of events was preliminary and state officials were still investigating the cause of the crash.
At least 19 people on the bus and two people in the truck were killed, the agency said. The injured were taken to Río Blanco Regional Hospital in Veracruz.
A message posted on a Facebook page associated with a parish in the archdiocese in Chiapas said the worshipers were returning from a weekend pilgrimage to the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City, Mexico’s most important Catholic shrine.
The accident occurred along a stretch of the highway known for its hairpin curves, fog and occasional crashes.
