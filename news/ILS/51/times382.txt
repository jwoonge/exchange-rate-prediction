Tel Aviv’s Toy-Block Tower Measures Up for a Record
Plastic building blocks are once again reaching for the sky.
This time, it was the city of Tel Aviv that made an attempt to build the tallest Lego tower — or, officially, the tallest structure built with interlocking plastic bricks, not all of them made by the Danish toy giant.
This attempt followed similar efforts in Milan in 2015 and in Budapest a year before that. Unlike its predecessors, however, the Tel Aviv effort is not sponsored by Lego. Instead, it’s a joint effort between Tel Aviv City Hall and Young Engineers, an organization that promotes learning with toy bricks. The tower is intended to honor a child who died from cancer.
Omer Sayag was 8 years old when he died in 2014. His former teachers, knowing his passion for building blocks, started the initiative to build the structure as a way to remember him. They called it Omer Tower.
Construction took half a million toy bricks and days of work. Thousands of people at more than two dozen community organizations around Tel Aviv worked from Dec. 12 to Dec. 24 to build sections of the tower, using colorful square blocks decorated with their groups’ insignia. The sections were then stacked together in Rabin Square in the city center over the last two days.
The names of some participating organizations were written on the tower in Hebrew or Arabic.
The result, announced on Wednesday, was a tower of 35.95 meters (or 117 feet 11 inches) — 90 centimeters, or 35 inches, taller than the structure built in Milan.
There was no Guinness World Records representative in Tel Aviv on Wednesday to measure the tower. City officials said they would submit their measurements and wait for confirmation that their tower was indeed the highest in the world.
