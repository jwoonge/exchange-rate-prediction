   Production for the Netflix series “Cowboy Bebop” will reportedly be put on hold for a while after star John Cho suffered a knee injury on set.

   Cho, 47, is reportedly back in Los Angeles, where the surgery will take place. 
   On Friday, the “Harold & Kumar" actor addressed the injury by sharing a Bruce Lee on his Instagram page: “Water can flow or it can crash.” Then in his own words, Cho thanked his supporters for their “well wishes.” 
   "Gonna be back and flowing in no time!” he concluded.
