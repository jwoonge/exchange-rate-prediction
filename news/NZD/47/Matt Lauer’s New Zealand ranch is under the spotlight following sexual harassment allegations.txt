   Matt Lauer's recent purchase of a New Zealand retreat is at risk because of the sexual harassment allegations that ended his career at "Today," according to a new report. 
   In February, Lauer bought a 27,000-acre lakeside farm near the resort town of Wanaka on New Zealand's South Island, according to Bloomberg. 
   He reportedly paid $9 million. 
   The picturesque nation scrutinizes land purchases by foreigners and requires they be of "good character." 
   The government "is aware that allegations have been made in relation to Matt Lauer and that he is no longer working for NBC News," Lisa Barrett, New Zealand's Deputy Chief Executive Policy and Overseas Investment, told Bloomberg. 
   "We are discussing this with his representative and are seeking further information." 
   Lauer, 59, was among television's highest-paid stars, earning $25 million annually. 
   He was fired Wednesday after NBC News said it received a complaint from a colleague about Lauer's "inappropriate sexual behavior." 
   Accusations surfaced in subsequent reports that he'd terrorized other female staffers. 
   Lauer has not commented about the allegations.
