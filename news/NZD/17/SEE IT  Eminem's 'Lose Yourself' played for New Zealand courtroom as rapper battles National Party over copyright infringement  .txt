   This isn't something you see every day in court. 
   "His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy." Those are the worlds that were blasted over a speaker in a New Zealand courtroom as part of rapper Eminem's ongoing lawsuit against the National Party. 
   On Monday, a room full of stone-faced lawyers and judges sat as Eminem's legal representative Gary Williams played the 2002 Grammy-winning track for them. 
   According to Newshub, the song was played for several minutes before the alleged instrumental version used by the National Party was played for the courtroom. 
   Williams also dissected the lyrics of the song telling the courtroom that the track, from Eminem's movie "8 Mile," is about "not missing opportunities in life." 
   "That's why the song appeals to both the public and those who wish to influence the public by using it in advertising," Williams said, according to The Guardian. 
   Eminem, who was not present in court, sued the country's political party in 2014 after he claimed the beat for "Lose Yourself" was used in an election campaign ad for then-leader John Key. At the time, Key was running for a re-election. 
   The National Party has denied it wrongly used the song saying the music in Key's ad, titled "Eminem Esque," came from the Australian-based production music library Beatbox. 
   According to The Guardian, the National Party argued that it thought using the instrumental was legal and said it's appeared in several other advertisements without issue. 
   The trial is expected to take six days.
