Australia’s Coastline  ‘A National Church’
Australia’s coastline has forever played a vital role in the life and mind of this country, and over the coming months, The New York Times will explore its sands and seas with a series of 360-degree videos.
We start this week when we roll out our expanded coverage of Australia and the region, with the video above that captures the Bold and Beautiful Swim Squad of Manly Beach, outside Sydney. It’s a colorful ad hoc club engaged in a daily ritual: At 7 a.m., seven days a week, the group gathers, puts on pink caps and swims to Shelly Beach and back, 750 meters each way, almost a mile in all.
