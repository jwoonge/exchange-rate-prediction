Another year on its way out the door, and what a year it’s been.
Australia lost a prime minister. The United States gained a congressional check on President Trump’s power and China found itself with a leader for life in Xi Jinping.
Power shifted elsewhere too. The world’s technology dynamos, especially Facebook and Tesla, battled stiff headwinds and criticism as they continued to reshape how we all interact, for good or ill, while abusive men continued to fall like dominoes in year two of the #MeToo movement.
Here at The New York Times, we tried to keep you up to date and add our particular perspective — global, nuanced, fair — at least as often as we could.
So to finish off 2018, we’ve pulled together some of our most popular articles and themes for Australian readers, with some additional links from Crikey, the (very) independent Australian news source we’ve partnered with in our Morning Briefing, Australia Edition.
If you’ve enjoyed free access to those Crikey articles via the briefing, Crikey has a special offer for you: you can save $40 and get an additional two months for free when you take out an annual membership and use the promocode NYTXCRIKEY.
You’re also welcome, of course, to purchase a New York Times subscription for yourself or that special someone you’ll be arguing with over the holidays.
Here’s how to make sure you’re prepared: Our Big Stories of 2018, from Australia and the great beyond.

Australia got a new prime minister this year. Again. We looked for answers in Canberra with Scott Morrison, and even in his church, while Crikey had a lot to say about Malcolm Turnbull.
• Scott Morrison Is a New Kind of Australian Prime Minister: An Evangelical Christian: Australia’s new leader has talked openly and often about his evangelical Christian faith — a rarity in Australian politics.
• Opinion | Trump Finally Makes a Friend: Maureen Dowd sits down with Scott Morrison and discovers that while the president may be shunned nearly everywhere, in Australia, he has finally found a loyal mate.
• Crikey: Thus Passes the Goriness of the World. Malcolm Turnbull, the wheeler-dealer son of a pub broker, finally ended up in a room he couldn’t pass through on the way to something else.

In 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker set off an unprecedented movement that forced out some of the world’s most powerful titans of industry. But did the movement turn out to have limits?
• #MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men. Nearly Half of Their Replacements Are Women. After Harvey Weinstein’s spectacular fall (and all those who toppled after), companies were left with vacant leadership positions. Who would be less “risky” to fill them – men or women?
• The Cost of Telling a #MeToo Story in Australia Yael Stone’s account of Geoffrey Rush’s alleged sexual harassment, as told to Bari Weiss, was widely discussed due to the story’s complexity of complicitness. What if you had encouraged your harasser?
• Crikey: The limits of Me Too and the traumatic Personal Narrative: #MeToo isn’t a movement, Helen Razer argues. It hasn’t moved for a year.

• Australia Wilts From Climate Change. Why Can’t Its Politicians Act? Why, despite Australia’s reputation for progressiveness on gun control, health care and wages, do its energy politics seem forever doomed to devolve into a circus?
• Where Do Birds Flock Together? Australians Are Mailing In Feathers to Help Find Out: A fun story about clever crowdsourcing of climate change research — by asking Australians to pick up feathers and put them in the post.
• Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change: A long but essential read, worth revisiting over the holidays. A tragic story of this planet and how nothing stood in our way to save it – but ourselves.
• Crikey: Australia Can’t Afford Another Decade of Climate Inaction: There are many ways Australia can turn this all around, Chris Wood writes. But we can’t sit on our hands any longer.
______
The New York Times’s most ambitious international series this year, China Rules, showed how a country mired in poverty beat the odds to become a superpower. It was one effort among many to explain China’s strengths and weaknesses.
• The Land That Failed: The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It’s still waiting.
• How China Walled Off The Internet: Censorship and why it works for China.
• China Is Detaining Muslims in Vast Numbers. The Goal: ‘Transformation.’
• In China, Desperate Patients Smuggle Drugs. Or Make Their Own. Despite health insurance, terminally ill patients have to hunt around the world and on the internet for ways to stay alive.
• Crikey: What Are Morrison’s Chances of Reconciling With China? Scott Morrison is quietly continuing Malcolm Turnbull’s attempts to mend relations with the wannabe regional hegemon, but he has his work cut out for him.
