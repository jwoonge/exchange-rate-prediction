Six Decapitated Seal Pups Found on New Zealand Beach
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Conservation workers in New Zealand condemned the “cruel and senseless” killings of six fur seal pups, which were found decapitated in a popular bay on the country’s South Island.
Andy Thompson, a spokesman for New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, said in a statement that the police were investigating the deaths because of “the disturbing, brutal and violent nature of this crime.”
The bodies of the 11-month-old seals were found on Monday by a tourism operator in Scenery Nook, a remote but popular part of Banks Peninsula on the South Island.
Conservation workers could not find the seals’ heads, the statement said, and the department believed the animals had been killed elsewhere before being dumped from a boat.
Mr. Thompson said in his statement Wednesday that the cause of death was being investigated. “It’s incredibly unlikely sharks would have bitten the heads off six seals but left the bodies untouched,” he added.
The department said frustration over low fish stocks in the ocean had led people to hurt or kill seals before.
“Regrettably, antagonism toward seals is often due to the misplaced belief that seals are eating large amounts of fish species valued for human consumption. That isn’t the case,” Mr. Thompson said. He added that 90 percent of the Banks Peninsula fur seals’ diet consists of lantern fish, “which are not sought after in fishing.”
Fur seals are a protected species in New Zealand, and harassing, disturbing or harming them is illegal. Anyone caught killing or hurting fur seals or other marine mammals faces up to two years in jail or a fine of up to $169,000.
In July, four teenagers were accused of fatally shooting a protected leopard seal in Northland, on the North Island. Two seals were shot dead in Kaikoura, on the South Island, in 2013. Also that year, a man was jailed and another sentenced to home detention for clubbing 23 seals to death in Kaikoura in 2010.
