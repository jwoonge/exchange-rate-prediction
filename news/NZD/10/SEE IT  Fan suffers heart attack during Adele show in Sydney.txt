   A 47-year-old woman went into cardiac arrest at an Adele performance as she sat in the front row. 
   "It took a full song for the actual on-site medics to respond," Daniel Lowe told 9news.com.au, explaining that security initially thought the fan had simply fainted at Friday evening's show. 
   "They then started performing chest compressions for a good 15 to 20 minutes until ambulance officers arrived with proper equipment." 
   The "Rolling in the Deep" songstress stopped the show at Sydney, Australia's ANZ Stadium when she noticed something was wrong to inform the crowd that the evening's fireworks were nixed. 
   "Sorry. Someone got hurt. I ruined the surprise for you didn't I?" she said. "Sorry, there was so much going on it frightened me. Pretend I didn't say anything. Let's start again." 
   Adele was "visibly upset for the rest of the show," according to Lowe. 
   The following night, the London-born soloist dedicated a performance to her ailing admirer at the same venue, the New Zealand Herald reports. 
   "I knew what was going on, but I was really scared, and it was at this point I stopped the show to make sure she was OK. I don't know if she's OK yet but I'd like to sing this song for her tonight." 
   She then belted out "Take It All," the song that was playing when the woman collapsed. 
   Said Adele, "I wish you a speedy recovery. I look forward to finding out who you are, I don't know who she is yet and I'll be speaking to you soon, I hope." 
   The fan's identity and current status remains unknown, though she was in serious condition when she was brought to Westmead Hospital.
