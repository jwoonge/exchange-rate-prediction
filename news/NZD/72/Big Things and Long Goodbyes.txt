After the muddy roads and the mangroves and after circling the curtain figand after the Big Things: the marlin on its tail,the cane toad splitting the medianthe mango towering over the A1,but before seeing Mary Poppins in the rainand before climbing the stairs into the big pineappleand before starting our lives over again —we walked into the caves.
Near-extinct ferns grew above us.You held my hand tight as the shadows shiftedand we went deeper into the darkness.The guide taught us of geology, dynamite.Then we were in the cave-cathedral, limestonestretching tall. The lights went off,and we were awash in the deepest dark.Our eyes searched for a hint of June sunshine,then stars. Bats darted through the cool air.Your breath stayed steady. We were in the quiet.Whatever was to happen would happen.
Minutes passed; we got used to the dark.Unexpectedly, the caves lit up again.We made our way back to the carpark,our footsteps echoing as we squeezedand then crawled the last meters from the caveback to the campervan, back to the road.Our lives were still hundreds of kilometers awaywaiting for us with the patience of the coastwaiting as the befores and afters faded and left usalone and here together, now.
