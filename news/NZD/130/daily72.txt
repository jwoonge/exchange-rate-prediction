USWNT vs. Netherlands World Cup Final  Everything you need to know about Sunday’s title clash
   The World Cup final is here, with the U.S. having survived a tough group and a brutal knockout stage draw to face the Netherlands on Sunday morning. The Americans are clear favorites, but their last three wins have been hard-fought, suggesting a disciplined opponent would have a chance to pull off an upset. Here’s everything you need to know about the game. 
   WHERE: Lyon, France  
   STADIUM: Parc Olympique Lyonnais (capacity 59,186) 
   WHEN: 11 AM ET (5 PM local time) 
   TV: Fox (Aly Wagner, JP Dellacamera) / Telemundo (Copan Alvarez, Viviana Vila) 
   ROAD TO THE FINAL:  
   The U.S. went through what was widely considered the harder side of the bracket, mowing down Spain, France and England in three straight 2-1 wins. 
   The Netherlands faced some elite teams in the knockout stage, including 2015 Cup finalists Japan and 2016 Olympic silver medalists Sweden, but were unimpressive in their 1-0 semifinal win over the Swedes.  
   Both teams went 3-0 in the group stage, where the U.S. defeated Chile, Sweden and Thailand, and the Netherlands beat New Zealand, Cameroon and Canada. 
   U.S. COACH: Jill Ellis 
   Ellis, 52, has a storybook background: she grew up in England, where women’s soccer was banned until the 1970s — and therefore didn’t start playing soccer until high school, when her family moved to the United States.  
   The oft-maligned Ellis has steered her team to a second straight World Cup final, cementing a legacy as one of the most successful coaches in the history of the sport. But her lineup choices have come under fire, particularly benching star midfielder Lindsey Horan against France and Spain. Horan is widely considered one of the very best players in the world, and finally started against England.  
   Her tendency to hang on to her substitutes until very late — and even then bring on 2015 hero Carli Lloyd as a midfielder — is also questionable. The injury to Rose Lavelle might force Ellis to use her best midfield: Horan, Julie Ertz and Sam Mewis.  
   NETHERLANDS COACH: Sarina Wiegman  
   The 49-year-old Wiegman is a product of the American college system. She was part of the University of North Carolina’s dynasty that won 16 NCAA titles in 19 years, playing on the 1989 and 1990 teams with U.S. legends Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly. As a player, she was the first man or woman to play 100 games for the Dutch national team.  
   She’s been the Dutch coach since early 2017, and was named the FIFA Coach of the Year that year for leading the team to the European title.  
   Both teams usually play a 4-3-3 formation. 
   The Americans are the sport’s preeminent power, having won three of the seven World Cup titles so far. As the defending champions, they’re seeking to join Germany as the only nations to win consecutive women’s World Cups. The USWNT has reached the semifinals in eight straight World Cups, and the final in three straight, splitting the last two with Japan.  
   The Netherlands have a far less decorated past, coming into the tournament with no Olympic qualifications and only one World Cup knockout round under their belts. But they won the European title in 2017, instantly marking them as one of the best squads in the world. 
   “We win any way possible and it is the DNA of this team, is to win no matter what.” — U.S. defender Abby Dahlkemper. 
   “Finding a way to win is winning, straight up. It doesn’t matter to me how. Whatever it takes has been the mentality and the mindset of this team. The big credit to this group of players is that they are incredibly tight, you can see that. They pull for each other, they are invested in each other, they have each others backs.” - U.S. coach Jill Ellis. 
   “The Americans are massive, they have massive players. They are the biggest team in the world but I can’t wait to play.” - Dutch midfielder Jackie Groenen. 
   ODDS: The U.S. is a -250 favorite, while the Netherlands is a +700 underdog. The U.S. is favored by a goal, with the total sitting at 2.5 as of Friday.
