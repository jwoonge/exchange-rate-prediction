The seven best goal celebrations of the World Cup
   The World Cup comes to a close on Sunday with the U.S.-Netherlands final. Here’s a look back at our favorite goal celebrations from an electric month of soccer in France. 
   Nchout’s stunning elimination of New Zealand at the last possible second might have been the most exciting goal of the tournament, and her teary reaction lived up to it. 
   White had plenty of chances to practice her signature celebration, as her six goals have her tied with Alex Morgan headed into Sunday’s final 
   I’d be in favor of soccer players hiding flip phones somewhere in the stadium to take the fake call celebration to the next level. 
   The Americans have to hope that the Dutch don’t get a chance to get this emotional on Sunday. 
   “COME GET ME,” by the person who has maybe been the most prepared to say it. Megan Rapinoe could be saying it to a right back or to Donald Trump, and either would be a fly on her windshield. 
   This was the goal that gave Marta the men’s and women’s career high-scorer World Cup record, and the moment she rocked Italy to sleep. 
   No one deserves open mockery more than the British; no one delivers it better than Alex Morgan did here. That it apparently offended one of her British NWSL teammates is just a bonus.
