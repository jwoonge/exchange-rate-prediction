   Do fries come with that Shayk? 
   With a little help from Bradley Cooper, super model Irina Shayk became a mom in March. And she's not depriving herself of the things she enjoys in order to drop the baby weight. 
   "My guilty pleasure is McDonald's," she confessed while hosting the opening on the Intimissimi lingerie store in midtown. "Every time I'm flying out of JFK I'm running to terminal 7, I think it is. This corner McDonalds, chicken nuggets, I love it. I don't feel bad eating it. Life is too short to be on a diet. I get like 12 pieces of chicken nuggets with extra barbecue sauce." 
   Shayk says that it takes her five minutes to scarf down that delicacy and never gets sideways glances from McDonald's patrons who may not be used to seeing a super model in their midst. Shayk also insists that she's not in cahoots with the burger chain. 
   "I swear they didn't pay me to say that now," she laughed. She also said it's great that the success of "really shapey" have made it so models don't have to starve themselves to stay in the business. And if all goes according to plan for Shayk, it'll be a while before she's applying for a job under the Golden Arches. 
   "Hopefully I won't retire anytime soon. I'm still 31," said Shayk. "I want to travel for a year. I want to travel to Australia and New Zealand and I love Madagascar, that's my favorite place." 
   Whether she'd be travelling with Cooper and their daughter, Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper, is a mystery. 
   "I don't comment on my personal life and I'm not going to talk about my baby," she said.
