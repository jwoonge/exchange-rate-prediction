   A Russian weightlifter’s leg snapped as he squatted more than 550 pounds — and the horrifying moment was captured on camera. 
   Yaroslav Radashkevich had experienced leg problems for weeks, according to the New Zealand Herald, and his right leg gave out under him during the event Sunday at the Eurasian Weightlifting Championship in the eastern Russian city of Khabarovsk. 
   The gruesome moment the 20-year-old’s leg bent and snapped was captured on video. 
   Radashkevich said he had been told his leg injury would pass, the Herald reported. 
   But something went wrong at the event. 
   “The first two efforts the same weight, starting, I could not squat down. In the first and second attempts I strained a bit, my knees inward, outward, shaken. And after that the pain in the shins intensified,” Radashkevich said in Russian to Amur, a Russian news site. “Well, in the third attempt, the same weight — when I squatted, something happened — you can see in the video.” 
   He was hospitalized after the injury, a compound fracture of his right tibia.
