   Authorities in New Zealand have filed a terrorism charge against the Australian man accused of gunning down 51 worshipers inside two different mosques in Christchurch. 
   New Zealand Commissioner of Police Mike Bush in a statement announced Brenton Tarrant was charged Tuesday with “engaging in a terrorist act,” which comes with a maximum sentence of life behind bars. The 28-year-old suspect is additionally facing 51 murder charges and 40 counts of attempted murder for opening fire inside a pair of mosques amid weekly prayer services. 
   New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was quick to condemn the shootings as acts of terror the same day the violence unfolded on March 15. 
   “It is clear this can only be described as a terrorist attack,” she said at the time. 
   Dozens of worshipers were gathered inside the Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch when the gunman – with a camera strapped to his head, set to record the terror – opened fire. From there, authorities said the Australia-native drove several miles across the city and unleashed another round of gunfire inside a mosque in Linwood. 
   Authorities later arrested Tarrant, who published a manifesto rife with anti-Muslim and white supremacist rhetoric ahead of the attacks. He was charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 counts of attempted murder, but authorities on Tuesday added on an additional murder charge for a Turkish man who died from his wounds earlier this month and another two charges of attempted murder. 
   In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the deadliest in New Zealand’s history, Ardern announced a nationwide ban on semiautomatic military weapons, similar to the one used by Tarrant, to prevent a similar attack from happening again in the future. 
   The accused shooter is slated to return back in court on June 14.
