It was less than a week ago that Scott Morrison’s victory shocked many Australians, leaving the country scrambling for explanations and asking: Are Australian cities out of touch with their rural counterparts? What happened to the so-called climate change election? Is our democracy becoming more populist?
Since then, the surprise win has dominated the news. But unsurprisingly, other things also happened — things that may save us yet from election news fatigue.
Like the very important news that, after a long battle with Melbourne and Brisbane, Sydney has finally secured the Australian premiere of “Hamilton” — the hip-hop musical about the rise and fall of one of America’s founding fathers, for which tickets in New York City can cost hundreds of dollars.
As one Times critic put it after the show’s Broadway debut in 2015: “Yes, it really is that good.”
And last week, the country singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves joined a cohort of celebrities who, at Australians’ insistence, have “quaffed from a boot” when she drank tequila from a glass slipper in Melbourne, writes Tacey Rychter.
Here’s everything you never wanted to know about the “shoey,” a drinking tradition popping up in Australian live music.
A meteor also shot hundreds of kilometers across the sky in the southern part of Australia on Tuesday evening, and then, of course, there was the “Game of Thrones” finale, which — depending on your feelings about the Mad Queen — bitterly divided viewers.
So to give your mind (and your soul) a well-deserved break, we’ve curated the best stories this week that are not about politics — at least not directly — from The Times.
• Did Aretha Franklin Leave Her Will Under the Couch Cushion?: Handwritten documents with cross-outs, marginal notes and salty tangents were discovered in the celebrated singer’s house, raising questions about her intentions.
• Talk Dirty With Machine: Tech entrepreneurs have created computer programs that serve as proxies for romantic partners designed to help woeful daters sext, ghost and develop a vocabulary around consent.
• The Pleasure of Watching Others Confront Their Own Incompetence: A video in which an unknown artist makes drawing a hand look easy has been mimicked hundreds of times, revealing that most people are bad at drawing hands (and we enjoy watching them fail).
• Samin Nosrat’s 10 Essential Persian Recipes: The most powerful form of cultural immersion Samin Nosrat experienced as a child was culinary, she writes. Here, the author of “Salt Fat Acid Heat” shares some of her favorite, and herb-filled, recipes.
• How Much Alcohol Can You Drink Safely?: Sorting through the latest research on how to optimize your well-being is a constant and confounding feature of modern life. So which studies should you trust?
Also, we’d love to know: How do you escape the news cycle when it gets too much? Or is it difficult for you to unplug? Write to us at nytaustralia@nytimes.com or join our NYT Australia Facebook group to share.
Now for a round-up of stories from our bureau and beyond. (And yes, some are election-related. Feel free to avoid.)

Since our story on the humble “shoey” was released into the world, responses to the trend have varied from horror to amusement. For one Australian reader in our NYT Facebook group, it was brand-new information.
“Well, in my over 50 years of being an Australian, I have never seen anyone drink out of a shoe — I didn’t know it was a thing, I didn’t know there was a name for it, and I didn’t know it was a ‘great Aussie tradition’. Are we having a laugh at these gullible visitors by encouraging them to participate in this ‘tradition?’ They should get Tim Tams instead.”
