   Whitney Houston fans may not always love Lorde. 
   The New Zealand-born pop star posted then quickly deleted a tone-deaf Instagram photo of her bathtub Thursday. 
   "And iiii will always love you," she captioned the image, a clear reference to Houston's iconic song, originally recorded by Dolly Parton. 
   In 2012, Houston was found dead at the Beverly Hilton hotel after drowning in the bathtub. An autopsy ruled that she had drowned and that "heart disease and cocaine use" contributed to the 48-year-old singer's death. 
   Three years later, her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, spent six months in a coma after being found face down in a bathtub at home in Georgia. She died in hospice care in July 2015 at just 22 years old. 
   An hour after she posted her bathtub photo, Lorde deleted the image and issued an apology. 
   "Extremely extremely poorly chosen quote," she wrote in an Instagram story. "I'm so sorry for offending anyone â€” I hadn't even put this together I was just excited to take a bath. I'm an idiot. Love Whitney forever and ever. Sorry again." 
   While fans argued over whether the caption was a pointed insult or a simple mistake, others realized that the deletion probably took so long because the "Green Light" singer was relaxing in the tub. 
   "The funniest thing is how everybody is in Lorde's comment section like 'SIS DELETE THIS NOO' and she's probably in her bathtub, no f--king clue what's going, having the time of her life," one person tweeted.
