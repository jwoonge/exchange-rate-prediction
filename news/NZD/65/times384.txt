Russell Crowe Holds a ‘Divorce’ Auction (‘Gladiator’ Stuff Included)
The auction on Saturday at Sotheby’s Australia in Sydney carried a provocative title: “The Art of Divorce.”
The catalog is pulled from the long film career and the personal possessions of the Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe.
The sale took place on the actor’s 54th birthday and the anniversary of his wedding to the singer Danielle Spencer in 2003.
Mr. Crowe split from Ms. Spencer in 2012, and they finalized their divorce last year.
In promoting the event  on Twitter in February, the actor said he just had to get rid of lots of stuff. The 227 items on auction ran the gamut, from paintings and movie memorabilia to prop horses, a motorbike and a Mercedes.
At the sale, he was serenaded by the singer Alisa Nasteski, and the crowd gave him three cheers just before a violin by Leandro Bisiach sold for 135,000 Australian dollars, or $104,000, according to The Associated Press.
Here are a few of the other items that went up for sale.
The body armor worn in the scene depicting (spoiler!) the death of the character Maximus in the 2000 hit “Gladiator” went on the block (estimated price 20,000 to 30,000 Australian dollars, or about $15,400 to $23,000). It sold for 125,000 Australian dollars ($96,000).
Also on offer from the film, for which he won a Best Actor Oscar: a codpiece; a fully functioning copy of a Roman chariot (65,000 Australian dollars); a wooden sword; a pair of leather wrist cuffs; and life-size prop horses.
The actor tweeted that he was putting 29 watches on the block, including a yellow-gold Rolex at a high-end estimate of 50,000 Australian dollars.
He told The Financial Times this year: “The first watch that I can remember having was a black on black Swatch.” But he said, “You could say my film career began with a fake Cartier. I wore it until the gold flaked off.”
“Even though it was fake,” he added, “it gave me a lot of confidence.”
Also displayed was his costume from the 2003 period drama “Master and Commander” (sold for 115,000 Australian dollars). Mr. Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey, who commands the British Royal Navy frigate Surprise as it hunts down a formidable French vessel off the South American coast during the Napoleonic Wars.
The 128-year-old violin the actor played in the movie was among the most expensive sales of the night. However, a painting from Mr. Crowe’s collection by the Australian artist Brett Whiteley, “Moreton Bay Fig and Palms,” beat the auction estimate, fetching 190,000 Australian dollars.
Some critics say Mr. Crowe turned in some of his finest work in “Gladiator” and 1997’s “L.A. Confidential,” in which he played Bud, a block-headed but principled cop caught up in a torrid love triangle with a call girl played by Kim Basinger and a fellow police officer played by Guy Pearce.
Posters from his movies were expected to fetch 500 to 2,500 Australian dollars.
The actor — who has also performed as a rock singer and guitarist, with bands called 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and the Ordinary Fear of God — also sold a trove of guitars from the 1950s onward, along with a New York-made Martin acoustic model dating to 1870 and estimated to fetch up to 100,000 Australian dollars.
There was another musical memento, too: the 1986 Grammy Award won by Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman for interviews from the “Class of ’55 Recording Session.” Estimated value: 200,000 to 300,000 Australian dollars.
Other items included the maroon Doc Martens boots Mr. Crowe wore as the skinhead in the 1992 movie “Romper Stomper” (sold for 10,000 Australian dollars); a purple double-breasted suit he wore in the 1995 film “Virtuosity”; the used leather jock strap he wore to play the heavyweight champion James Braddock in 2005’s “Cinderella Man” (went for 7,000 Australian dollars after intense bidding, The A.P. says); a collection of cricket memorabilia, including a New Zealand Test cricket “200 Club” bat; plus diamond rings, necklaces and earrings.
• A collection of 20th-century Australian art, including paintings by Charles Blackman and Sidney Nolan.
• Motorbikes, including one valued at 2.3 million Australian dollars.
• A 2001 Mercedes-Benz S500. Estimated value: 15,000 to 25,000 Australian dollars.
“One of Russell Crowe’s personal cars,” a note next to the car says, “this vehicle also served as one of the wedding cars on the day of his marriage to Danielle Spencer on 7 April 2003.”
The event had been expected to rake in 2.6 million to 3.7 million Australian dollars. Mr. Crowe tweeted after the five-hour auction that it had pulled in 3.7 million, with potential sales worth 350,000 Australian dollars still under negotiation.
“A bunch of stuff I didn’t really want to sell coming home … not a bad hourly rate for a 5 hour shift,” he wrote.
The auction raised money for the A.C.M.F. charity, which provides free music education and instruments to disadvantaged and indigenous children and youth at risk in Sydney. It was streamed live on the actor’s Facebook page.
