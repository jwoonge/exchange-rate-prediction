Salary of Australia Post’s Chief Draws Scrutiny of Executive Pay

Public outrage over the 5.6 million Australian dollars, or $4.3 million, that was paid to Ahmed Fahour of Australia Post has prompted Senate hearings, and the chairman of the agency defended Mr. Fahour’s compensation at one such hearing on Tuesday.
