Nigel Hayes signs partially guaranteed contract with Knicks
   The Knicks have signed Nigel Hayes to a partially guaranteed contract, the Daily News has confirmed. 
   The Wisconsin forward played for the Knicks' summer league squad after going undrafted. 
   "Happy and appreciative of the Knicks for giving me an opportunity to help the organization," Hayes told the News. 
   The 22-year-old ripped New York when he traveled to the Big Apple to play at the Garden during the NCAA Sweet 16 earlier this year. 
   "I don't really like New York," Hayes said. "It's too big, it's dirty, there's trash everywhere, too many people. It's cold right now." 
   Clearly, Hayes has decided that he'll put that behind him and deal with life in the big city. 
   A partially guaranteed deal is the equivalent of a training camp invite. The Knicks already have 14 players on guaranteed contracts, theoretically leaving one spot open for the opening day roster. 
   Guard Chasson Randle, who is also on a partially guaranteed deal, is a frontrunner to win it. 
   Hayes struggled while playing for New York's Summer League squad in July, averaging 5.2 points on 41 percent shooting in five games.
