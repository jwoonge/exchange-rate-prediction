LeBron James declines player option with Cavs, will become free agent  reports
   Let another Summer of LeBron James begin. 
   James’ agent has informed the Cavaliers that the superstar will not exercise his $35.6 million option with the team and will instead become an unrestricted free agent, according to multiple reports. 
   James had until 11:59 p.m. Friday to make his decision, which comes as a surprise to neither the Cavs nor the rest of the NBA. The free-agent market officially opens at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. 
   The four-time MVP, who has led Cleveland to the NBA Finals for the last four years, has plenty of options to consider regarding where he chooses to take his talents next. 
   James has been linked to the Western Conference, such as the Rockets and Lakers, the latter of which has been in talks with the Spurs to acquire Kawhi Leonard. Los Angeles has also been rumored as a possible destination for Paul George, who has declined his player option with the Thunder. 
   The Daily News’ Frank Isola has reported that the Sixers, Celtics, Clippers and Heat are also in play for James, but that the Lakers and the hometown Cavs appear to be leading the charge. James could re-sign with Cleveland and become a free agent again next summer. 
   The Cavs could also reportedly offer him a five-year max contract worth upwards of $200 million, while any offer from another would be capped at four years and $152 million.
