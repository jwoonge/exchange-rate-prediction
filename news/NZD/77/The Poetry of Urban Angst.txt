Huddled on the edge of a continent, We teeter on the brink of chaos.
Surrounded by sea,We are isolated, yet connectedBy millions of devices.Deep sea cables and satellites Feed our hunger for data;We consume itAnd believe it.
Reaching for the heavens,Our skyscrapers soar.We work in towers of glass and steelAnd live in urban sprawl:The Australian Dream?Or a corrupted fantasy…
The boomers worked 9 to 5,They bought the Australian dream and more.The others work 9 to 5,We work and earn,But can’t affordTheir dream.They dream of investment properties:Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one study,Renovated and negatively geared.We dream of avocado:Smashed, seasoned and thickly smearedOn sourdough toastWith feta.Huddled on the edge of a continent,We teeter on the brink of chaos.We dream of sangria and chia,We eat brunch in Flinders LaneAnd drink pints on Brunswick Street,We pay 1 percent card surcharges,Not 10 percent housing deposits.We long for real interaction,But only talk on Messenger,We share pictures of bagels for seven secondsAnd watch the news headlines in 60,But never read a newspaper.We live in a land,Attached to devices,Of sprawling citiesAnd ever-increasing prices.We dream of a great southern land,A dream which never ends.
