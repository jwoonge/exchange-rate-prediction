Sale of ANZ stake in Malaysia's AmBank scrapped as RHB deal collapses  sources
   By Liz Lee and Anshuman Daga 
   "KWAP is only interested in the merged entity," one of the people said, although he added that KWAP had once expressed interest in ANZ's stake prior to AmBank's talks with RHB. 
   The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. ANZ and KWAP declined to comment. 
   ANZ has been trying to sell its AmBank stake since early last year as it dials down its ambitions in the region and divests minority holdings. 
   AmBank has also lost some of its luster after it was dragged into a political scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd and Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has been buffeted by allegations of graft, in particular by revelations of the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into his AmBank account in 2013. 
   The same source said the talks had faltered on differences in valuations that arose from contingent liabilities. 
   Shares in RHB climbed 3.9 percent in late Wednesday trade after the collapse while those in AmBank fell 2.3 percent. ANZ's stock ended flat. 
   Hong Leong Investment Bank research analyst Khairul Azizi Kairudin said in a note on Wednesday that both RHB and AmBank had likely found it difficult to extract synergies from the deal. 
   "In addition, we see another stumbling block being the huge overlaps for both banks serving similar markets," he said.
