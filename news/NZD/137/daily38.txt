YouTuber PewDiePie marries longtime girlfriend, former vlogger Marzia Bisognin
   The controversial YouTuber known as PewDiePie has officially settled down. 
   Felix Kjellberg, a Swedish gamer better known by the YouTube handle PewDiePie, married former beauty vlogger Marzia Bisognin, Kjellberg tweeted early Tuesday. 
   “We are married!!! I’m the happiest I can be,” Kjellberg, 29, revealed alongside several portraits of the nuptials, which E! News reports took place in London on Monday. 
   “Yesterday, the 19th of August – after exactly 8 years since we met – we celebrated our wedding with our closest friends and family,” Italian-born Bisognin, 26, wrote on Instagram. “Incredibly ecstatic to be able to call Felix my husband for the rest of our lives.“ 
   Kjellberg, who boasts over 99 million YouTube subscribers, has been the subject of several controversies in recent years. 
   In March, the terrorist responsible for the New Zealand massacre at a Christchurch mosque told viewers to subscribe to Kjellberg’s YouTube in a since-deleted Facebook live stream of the rampage that killed 51 and injured dozens more. 
   “Remember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie,” the gunman said. 
   “I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person,” Kjellberg subsequently tweeted. “My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy.” 
   In 2017, Kjellberg apologized for using the N-word during a live stream and Disney severed ties with him after he published nine videos that reportedly included Nazi imagery or messages of anti-Semitism. In one such video, Kjellberg played the Nazi party anthem and bowed in front of a swastika.
