   An Australian couple will not serve time in jail despite keeping their infant daughter on a strict vegan diet that left her “severely malnourished" and developmentally delayed. 
   The unnamed Sydney parents, both in their 30s, will be given a community order, negating their previous 18-month jail sentence for letting their daughter’s health deteriorate, BBC News reports. The parents were also initially sentenced to 300 hours of community service. 
   Judge Sarah Huggett said in court Thursday that the now 3-year-old child’s strict vegan diet (which included little more than oats, rice milk, toast, potatoes, and tofu) was “completely inadequate.” 
   “This child was severely malnourished, underweight and undersized,” Huggett said, noting the poor girl was also “delayed as far as age-appropriate milestones were concerned.” 
   She was taken into care in March 2018 when she had a seizure and her mother contacted emergency services. Among other health issues, the little girl was suffering from rickets, according to The New Zealand Herald. 
   During a victim impact statement in May, her foster carer revealed that at 19 months old, the girl “couldn’t sit up, she couldn’t speak any words, she couldn’t feed herself or hold a bottle. She couldn’t play with toys." 
   Unlike babies about 4 months old, she was unable to rollover without an occupational therapist’s assistance and had no teeth. 
   She was found lacking a birth certificate, vaccinations and follow-up checkups. 
   She has two apparently healthy older brothers, ages 4 and 6, who also are on vegan diets. They have been put into government care as well. 
   Though Huggett said the parents are “not very young or uneducated," the mother reportedly suffered depression. She became “increasingly fixated” about beliefs that included their diets. The father is not a vegan. 
   The child, the carer said, was “defenseless and unable to protect herself from her parents’ inadequate care.”
