   Residents of Orange County, Calif., may have been exposed to measles at two Disney theme parks earlier in August, health officials said. 
   A teenage girl from New Zealand was infectious with measles when she visited Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park on Aug. 12. The Orange County Health Care Agency said the girl was in the area from Aug. 11-15 and stayed at the Desert Palms Hotel. 
   The health care agency is working with Disney and the hotel to contact anyone who may have had contact with the teen. 
   Anyone who visited the theme parks and hotel during that time is encouraged to monitor for a fever and/or unexplained rash anywhere between 7-21 days after potential exposure. 
   People who develop those symptoms should stay home and contact a doctor, officials said. 
   The CDC reports at least 1,203 cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states so far in 2019, with the biggest outbreak in the New York area.
