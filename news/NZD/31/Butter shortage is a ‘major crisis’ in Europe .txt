   Enjoy those croissants while you can still afford them. 
   A worldwide increase in the demand for butter has caused wholesale prices of the fatty spread to nearly double across Europe. This trickled down to the consumer level too, with shoppers paying 20% more in June compared to last year, according to data analysis from Euromonitor. 
   A group that represents bakers in France, the Federation des Entrepreneurs de la Boulangerie, called the lack of butter a "major crisis" that may lead to a steep price increase of pastries, croissants and brioches. 
   "The price of butter, while certainly volatile, has never reached such a level before," the group said in a statement. "Butter shortages appear to be a real threat by the end of the year." 
   While production of butter has slowed in Europe, the demand has increased. Recent studies have raised doubts over the spread's link to heart disease and there's been a notable shift in the global population's desire to eat more natural foods, like butter, and less processed items, like margarine. 
   "Health concerns are increasingly moving away from fats (like those found in dairy) towards sugars," Euromonitor food analyst Raphael Moreau told CNN Money. 
   Global butter consumption is expected to rise by 3% in 2017. In China, the USDA predicts a 38% jump in foreign milk consumption. The Asian nation receives almost all of its dairy from Europe and New Zealand. 
   The shortage in Europe is so severe that the European Commission's Milk Market Observatory says that butter stockpiles across the continent have been decimated by 98%.
