Three missing United States marines were officially declared dead and their identities were released on Monday, two days after their aircraft crashed into the water off eastern Australia.
They were named as Lt. Benjamin R. Cross, 26, of Oxford, Me.; Cpl. Nathaniel F. Ordway, 21, of Sedgwick, Kan.; and Pfc. Ruben P. Velasco, 19, of Los Angeles.
“The loss of every Marine is felt across our entire Marine Corps family,” said Col. Tye R. Wallace, the commanding officer of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Okinawa, Japan, to which the aircraft was assigned. “To the families of the brave Marines we lost — there is no way for us to understand what you are going through.”
Officials suspended the search for the missing Marines early Sunday morning, about 11 hours after their hybrid aircraft, an MV-22 Osprey, entered the water about 18 miles from the coast of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland. The 23 other members of the military who were aboard the aircraft were rescued.
After the search was suspended, the servicemen’s family members were notified of their deaths. The Marine Corps said that the circumstances of the crash, which it had termed a mishap, were under investigation. There were no updates on thecause by Tuesday morning.
The aircraft belonged to the Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265, nicknamed the Dragons. It had launched from the U.S.S. Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault ship, “and was conducting regularly scheduled operations” when it entered the water, an initial news release said.
The Royal Australian Navy located the MV-22 on Sunday and assisted in search and rescue operations. The Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft, was developed in the 1980s and earned a bad reputation after multiple crashes killed more than two dozen marines.
