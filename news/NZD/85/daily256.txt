Kobe Bryant won't be joining BIG3 next season, rep now says | Update
   So much for Kobe Bryant playing in the BIG3. 
   The internet was turned upside down Tuesday when league co-founder Jeff Kwatinetz hinted the future Hall of Famer would join the BIG3. 
   But Molly Carter, chief marketing officer of Kobe Inc., shut down the rumors, according to The Associated Press. 
   “I did hear from a credible source that Kobe is going to be playing next year,” Kwatinetz said in a conference call. “That’s something, but it may be nothing.” 
   It ended up being the latter. 
   A BIG3 press conference went viral last weekend when a reporter asked whether “The Black Mamba” would be able to handle the physicality of the league. 
   Stephen Jackson turned it into a recruiting opportunity, but it seems, to no avail. 
   Considering rumors of a return to the NBA were shot down by his wife, Vanessa, this would have been the next best thing.
