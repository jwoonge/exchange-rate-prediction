   A familiar name is leaving the NL East: Daniel Murphy. 
   The former Met was acquired by the Cubs on Tuesday, as the Nationals appear to be unloading players and giving up on their season, seemingly unable to catch the Braves and Phillies. 
   The Nats — who received Class-A Myrtle Beach second baseman Andruw Monasterio and a player to be named later or cash — also dealt Matt Adams to the Cardinals. Bryce Harper, however, is reportedly staying put. 
   This provides some infield insurance for the NL-leading Cubs, who are still without Kris Bryant. The third baseman hasn't played since July 23 due to left shoulder inflammation. Manager Joe Maddon had said he could return "at the best" before Sept. 1, but adding Murphy — who's batting .300 with six home runs and 29 RBI this season — certainly helps. 
   They also add a lefty bat that usually hurts them: Murphy’s beaten up on the Cubs throughout his career (.325 avg., 9 HRs, 22 RBI), and according to ESPN Stats & Info, his .413 career batting average at Wrigley Field is the highest in the ballpark’s history (with a minimum of 100 at-bats). 
   The 33-year-old, who spent seven seasons with the Mets, has also crushed his former team (.390 avg. with 11 HR and 43 RBI) since joining the Nats for the 2016 season. 
   Murphy is in the final year of a three-year, $37.5 million contract and will be owed about $3.84 million the rest of the season.
