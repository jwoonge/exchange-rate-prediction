   Stephen A. Smith may want to have a word with the newest Net. 
   Kenneth Faried was busted for marijuana possession Sunday during a DWI checkpoint on Long Island, according to 27east.com. 
   The 28-year-old forward was charged with 4th degree unlawful possession, a misdemeanor, after an officer noticed a “strong odor of marijuana was emanating from the inside of the vehicle” on Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton (Suffolk County). He was released on $500 bail. 
   “We are aware of the situation involving Kenneth Faried and are in the process of gathering more information at this time,” the team said in a statement to Nets Daily. 
   Faried, whom the Nets acquired from Denver earlier this offseason, reportedly had more than two ounces of the drug on him. Two others inside the car were ticketed then released for unlawful possession, indicating they had less marijuana on them. 
   The Nets picked up Faried and his $13.7 million contract alongside a 2019 protected first-round pick and a 2020 second-round pick as part of a salary dump with the Nuggets. He put up a career-worst 5.9 points in 32 games last season.
