New Zealand eatery angers Valentine's Day diners with offensive sign
   This is not a sign of the times. 
   New Zealanders don’t love a sandwich board placed outside Eiffel en Eden restaurant in Auckland telling men to treat their Valentine well today, but then throw her in the trunk of the car afterward. 
   “On Valentine’s Day open the car door for her. After Valentine’s Day open the car boot [trunk] for her,” the sign reads. 
   Writer Ana Samways drew attention to the sign by posting a photo of it on Twitter. Followers immediately started questioning the appropriateness of such a sign in the #MeToo era. 
   One user said she paid a visit to the eatery and smudged the chalk-written message. Other commenters felt the sign was posted in good humor. One user, who tweets under the handle Dr. Steph Borrelle blamed Eiffel en Eden’s owner of recycling bad jokes. 
   “I took this photo in March 2018 so this is a repeat offending of misogynist tropes,” Borrelle wrote. 
   The restaurant blocked its Facebook page amid the kerfuffle.
