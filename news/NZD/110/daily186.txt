El Nino is finally here but it's weak
   El Nino is finally here, barely. 
   The National Weather Service has been keeping its eyes peeled for El Nino for the past year and, now that it’s here, the agency says the outcome is very anticlimactic. 
   “We think this El Nino is very weak, very borderline case,” said climate scientist Michelle L’Heureux at National Weather Service. 
   During El Nino, sea temperatures rise across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These rising temperatures have an effect on atmospheric temperatures which lead to unusual weather. 
   These include wind pattern disruptions in the Pacific, heavy downpours in South America and droughts in areas such as Australia, New Zealand and surrounding islands. 
   It is not expected to have a significant impact on the U.S this spring but there will most likely be more precipitation in the coming months. 
   There needs to be a rise in both ocean and atmospheric temperatures for El Nino to occur. There is a less than 50% chance that El Nino will last beyond spring. 
   L’Heureux says it it difficult to see the effects of El Nino on a daily or weekly scale. It operates on a seasonal climate pattern. Its prime effects would been seen as a whole from January to April. 
   According to the Climate Prediction Center, El Nino’s next three-month seasonal outlook update will be posted on Feb. 21.
