   July was the hottest month on record for the planet, a U.S. environmental agency confirmed Thursday. 
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that the record-breaking heat shrank sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, to “historic lows.” 
   On July 5, the Copernicus Climate Change Programme of the European Union announced July was the hottest month on record. Now, NOAA confirms the data, stating that the average global temperature for the month was 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit above the average for the 20th century, at 60.4 degrees. 
   Sea ice levels also hit historic lows, the NOAA said, with the Arctic hitting 19.8% below the average level during the month of July. Antarctic ice levels were also 4.8% below the average seen from 1981 to 2010. 
   Parts of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, North and South America, Africa, and portions of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans all saw record-breaking high temperatures. 
   However, some parts of the earth saw temperatures below average. Parts of Russia and Scandinavia had temperatures 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit below the average, the NOAA said. 
   While it is typically the hottest month of the year, nine out of 10 of the record-breaking high temperatures during the month of July have occurred in the last 15 years, since 2005. The last five years have consecutively been the hottest recorded. 
   July 2019 was the 43rd consecutive July with temperatures above the average. It was also the 413th month with temperatures higher than the average, the NOAA said.
