FBI informant must wear disguise while testifying  judge
   A federal judge in Montana ordered an FBI informant to wear a wig or hat, false eyeglasses and fake facial hair when testifying in a terror trial. 
   The confidential informant must also wear loose-fitting clothing or a body suit and lifts in his shoes to further alter his appearance, U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen wrote in his order. 
   Federal prosecutors had previously requested the informant’s testimony be sealed from the public in order to protect him and his family, some of whom are still in the Middle East. 
   Christensen wrote that the disguise was necessary in order to preserve Fabjan Alameti’s right to a public trial. Alameti is accused of plotting an attack to avenge the deaths of Muslims during a shooting spree at two mosques in New Zealand. He was arrested in Bozeman, Mont., in April. 
   The judge cited a 2013 where a witness wore a wig and fake mustache while testifying against a drug cartel. The jury heard the witness’ voice, saw his eyes and facial reactions and observed his body language. 
   Christensen added that the informant’s testimony was the hinge of the case against Alameti. 
   According to prosecutors, Alameti told the informant he wanted to join the Islamic State to avenge the Christchurch victims. 
   Alameti told the informant that he would, “attack random people to avenge the blood,” FBI Special Agent Matthew Duermeier said in a sworn statement to the court. 
   Alameti’s attorney has said his client’s statements were protected under the First Amendment. 
   The trial is set to begin in September.
