   He’s giving Norway a black eye, and he’s got two of his own. 
   The man who attempted to shoot up a Norwegian mosque over the weekend showed up to court with a pair of black eyes Monday. 
   Norway’s state-run news outlet NRK reported Philip Manshaus, an alleged 21-year-old white supremacist wearing full body armor, was overpowered Saturday by an unarmed 65-year-old Muslim worshiper, who used a chokehold to detain the gunman until police arrived outside Oslo. State authorities would not confirm the shooter’s identity. 
   The failed suspect tried to livestream his attempted shooting spree on Facebook, but that effort was also unsuccessful. 
   It’s unclear exactly how the suspect’s face was bruised prior to his Monday appearance, where prosecutors asked that he be kept in isolation as they investigate his case. 
   Manshaus’ teenage stepsister was reportedly found dead in his home after the botched mosque attack. 
   Prior to his arrest Saturday, Manshaus appeared to have posted rhetoric on Internet message boards praising a racist gunman who killed 51 Muslims in New Zealand in March. He also gave a shoutout to the anti-immigrant shooter who slaughtered 22 people in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month. 
   Manshaus’ Instagram page included a photo of Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed nearly 80 people in a July 2011 terror attack.
