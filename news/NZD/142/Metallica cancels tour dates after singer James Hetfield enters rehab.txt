   Metallica is canceling an upcoming tour in Australia and New Zealand after singer and guitarist James Hetfield entered rehab. 
   “We are truly sorry to inform our fans and friends that we must postpone our upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand,” a statement signed by drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Rob Trujillo said Friday night. 
   “As most of you probably know, our brother James has been struggling with addiction on and off for many years. He has now, unfortunately, had to re-enter a treatment program to work on his recovery again.” 
   The band was scheduled to play five Australian cities from Oct. 17-29, followed by four shows in New Zealand. 
   The statement added that anyone who purchased tickets will receive refunds. 
   Hetfield’s previous struggles with addiction were chronicled in the 2004 documentary “Some Kind of Monster.”
