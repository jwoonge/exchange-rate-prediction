   A pair of little blue penguins were discovered camping out under a food truck serving sushi in Wellington, New Zealand, according to a Facebook Post by the Wellington District Police. 
   The small birds (adults weigh about two pounds) were discovered by Constable John Zhu after the police received multiple calls. Zhu determined the “waddling vagrants” were hiding under a food truck near a train station and took them into custody Monday morning. 
   The Wellington Police contacted New Zealand’s Department of Conservation, which took the birds into its care. 
   “Wellington’s little blue penguins with a taste for sushi have been moved to a nesting box,” the DOC tweeted. “Our rangers report that they seemed to like it and were making cooing noises which is a good sign.” 
   Wellington Police coordinated with the Department of Conservation and the Wellington Zoo to shepherd a wandering penguin to a nearby harbor last week, as well. 
   In response to the uptick in penguin sightings (they usually stick near water and move about at night), the Department of Conservation said that motorists should be extra cautious near the waterfront in order to avoid running over any road-crossing penguins who may be looking for burrows to mate or lay eggs.
