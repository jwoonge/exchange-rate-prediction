Taika Waititi and Chris Hemsworth back for fourth ‘Thor’ flick
   Look like there’s more where that came from. 
   After his movie grossed upwards to $854 million in the United States, Taika Waititi, who wrote and directed the 2017 blockbuster “Thor: Ragnarok” is back in the Marvel film fold. 
   The Oscar nominated filmmaker, actor and comedian — who injected new life and humor into the world of Thor — will return for a fourth film centering on the Norse god-turned Marvel hero, played by Chris Hemsworth, according to “The Hollywood Reporter.” 
   The New Zealand native made the leap into the blockbuster Marvel Comic Universe from indie films like oddball romantic comedy “Eagle vs. Shark” and 2010’s “Boy,” which was nominated for the Grand Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. His acclaimed 2004 short “Two Cars, One Night” was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short. 
   He co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed the 2014 vampire mockumentary “What We Do in the Shadows,” which was adapted into a hit FX series of the same name. 
   Waititi, 43, recently reprised one of his “Ragnarok” roles as the rock creature Korg in last spring’s gargantuan hit “Avengers: Endgame.” 
   He'll next be seen spoofing a version of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler in his dark comedy drama “Jojo Rabbit,” which is due in theaters in October. 
   Waititi’s return to the Marvel world has reportedly put his expected adaptation of the anime classic “Akira” for Warner Bros on hold.
