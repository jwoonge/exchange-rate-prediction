Suspect in New Zealand mosque attack to face 50 murder counts
   The suspect in the Christchurch mosque attacks will face the full force of the law in New Zealand, as police said Thursday he is to be charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 counts of attempted murder. 
   Brenton Tarrant, 28, will be charged with the new counts when he appears in court on Friday, New Zealand Police said Thursday. 
   Other charges are still under consideration, the department added. 
   The Australian native is accused of entering two mosques on March 15 and opening fire, killing 50 and injuring dozens more. 
   He will not be required to enter a plea at his Friday court appearance. The judge said the hearing will mainly be about his legal representation, according to the Associated Press. He has said he wants to represent himself. 
   Originally, he was only charged with one count of murder. New Zealandâ€™s Prime Minister vowed that more charges would follow. 
   The county has swiftly taken action to changes its gun laws in the aftermath of the mass shootings. 
   On Tuesday, a bill proposing to ban semiautomatic firearms, magazines and parts used to assembly illegal firearms passed its first reading in Parliament. The bill gained the support of every lawmaker in the house except one.
