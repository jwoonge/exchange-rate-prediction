New Zealand’s proposed firearm buyback could cost $300 million NZD ‘to set what’s wrong right’
   New Zealand’s proposed bill that would allow gun owners to hand in their semi-automatic firearms and be compensated for them could cost $300 million NZD ($202 million), Winston Peters, the country’s deputy prime minister, said Tuesday. 
   The legislation came after the Christchurch mosque terrorist attacks in which 50 people were killed on March 15. 
   The bill would ban semi-automatic firearms, magazine and parts used to assemble illegal firearms. Every lawmaker supported the bill in first readings except for one. David Seymour, the leader of ACT, a right-wing minority party, voted against it, saying it was too rushed. 
   The government originally estimated the buyback would cost between $100 to $200 million NZD, according to CNN. Peters noted Tuesday that it was hard to predict what it would cost because he didn’t know how many semi-automatic weapons were out there, but said the $300 million was possible. 
   “Now, this is an extravagant statement but it may well be true, it could cost up to $300 million to set what’s wrong right,” he told Radio New Zealand. 
   He disputed the claim of Nicole McKee, the secretary of the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, who said it would be “billions.” 
   “It’s not billions,” he said. 
   The public will have two days to make a submission on the bill before it goes back to Parliament next Tuesday for its second reading.
