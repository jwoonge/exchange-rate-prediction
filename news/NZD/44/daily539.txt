A ‘Lord of the Rings’ TV adaptation may soon be headed to Amazon
   It may soon be time to head back to Middle-earth — Amazon Studios is reportedly in "very early" talks to develop a television series based on J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy saga "The Lord of the Rings." 
   Variety reports that Warner Bros. and the late British author's estate are currently shopping a series based on the popular set of novels — and that Amazon has pulled ahead, with CEO Jeff Bezos's "personal" involvement. 
   It's no wonder the company would want to scoop up the classic tale of the Shire's adventuring hobbits: the trilogy's film adaptations by Peter Jackson — distributed by Warner Bros.' New Line Cinemas — were massive box office and critical successes. 
   The New Zealand director helmed three "Lord of the Rings" films, which have raked in more than $1 billion. 
   The final film, "The Return of the King," was released in 2003 and won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. 
   The news comes amid a series of changes over at Amazon, kick started by the resignation of studio head Roy Price, who stepped down last month after being accused of sexual harassment. 
   According to Deadline, the price tag for the rights to the project comes in at a whopping $200-250 million.
