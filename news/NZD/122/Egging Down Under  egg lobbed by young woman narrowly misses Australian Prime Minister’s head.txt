   Egg Boy, meet Egg Girl. 
   A young woman was seen lobbing an egg at the head of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as he spoke at the Country Women’s Association in Sydney. 
   The egg, according to Sky News of Australia, ricocheted off his head and presumably broke on the floor as the woman, who was not identified, ran off, allegedly knocking someone down in the process. 
   “The Prime Minister has narrowly avoided being hit with an egg while meeting delegates the Country Women’s Association conference in Albury,” reported the Financial Review of Australia. “A young woman who did not want to speak to the media threw the egg from behind the PM while he was mingling at a morning tea. The egg went over his head and landed nearby. Members of the Prime Minister’s staff said the woman responsible also knocked over an elderly lady.” 
   A motive was unclear. The egg thrower was hauled off by security immediately afterward, reported Sky News Australia, which posted video on Twitter. 
   Just over a month ago Morrison himself appeared to sanction such behavior after 17-year-old Will Connolly smashed a raw egg over the head of a far-right Australian senator in the wake of the massacres at two New Zealand mosques. Sen. Fraser Anning had appeared to blame the attacks, which were carried out by a far-right extremist, on Muslims. 
   The teen was immediately dubbed Egg Boy on social media and gained notoriety as well as a GoFundMe account. He pledged to donate most of the money received to victims of the massacres, which occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, and killed at least 50 people, with dozens wounded. 
   Anning had responded to his gesture by clocking the teen, and Morrison had appeared to sympathize with the youth. 
   “The full force of the law should be applied to Sen. Anning,” said Morrison, according to Market Watch. 
   Morrison did not hit the woman who attempted to egg him.
