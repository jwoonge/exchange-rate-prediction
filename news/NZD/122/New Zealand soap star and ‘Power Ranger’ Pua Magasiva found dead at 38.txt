   New Zealand soap opera star and “Power Rangers” actor Pua Magasiva was found dead Saturday. He was 38. 
   Authorities responded in the early hours to a Wellington residence, where they discovered the actor unresponsive, according to the New Zealand Herald. A police spokesman said there were no “suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.” 
   Magasiva, who was born in Samoa but raised in New Zealand, rose to fame on the long-running soap “Shortland Street,” where he played nurse Vinnie Kruse-Miller from 2003-2006, and again from 2011 to 2018. 
   He’s acted in more than 450 episodes of the popular New Zealand show. 
   “We are all absolutely devastated at the tragic news regarding Pua Magasiva,” reads a post on the Shortland Street Instagram page. 
   “Pua was a much loved member of the South Pacific Pictures’ family for many years and our hearts and thoughts go out to Pua’s family at this time.” 
   Magasiva also played Shane Clarke, the Red Wind Ranger, in “Power Rangers Ninja Storm” — the 11th television installment of the widely popular action show. 
   In a Facebook post, his “Power Rangers” co-star, Jason Chan, also mourned the loss of his actor friend. 
   “Incredibly sad to hear that one of our ranger family is gone. It will never be the same again,” he wrote. “Pua you will be so dearly missed. You were the center of energy on set and off. Always laughing, giggling and involved in practical jokes.” 
   Magasiva leaves behind a daughter from his first marriage and his wife, Lizz Sadler, who he married last year.
