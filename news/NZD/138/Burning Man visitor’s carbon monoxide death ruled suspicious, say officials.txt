   A New Zealand man who died Thursday at this year’s annual Burning Man festival might have been the victim of unnatural circumstances. 
   Authorities on Saturday deemed the death of 33-year-old Shane Billingham, who was discovered unconscious in his van at the Nevada desert fest, as suspicious, reported the Reno Gazette Journal. 
   Officials claimed the victim had toxic levels of carbon monoxide in his system, and the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office is investigating. 
   Results of Billingham’s autopsy revealed that he had “a concentration of carbon monoxide in his blood which would be considered poisonous to human life,” according to toxicology results shared by the sheriff’s office. 
   But drugs might have also played a factor in the man’s demise. 
   “Preliminary toxicology showed the presence of controlled substances to be an exacerbating factor,” stated the Washoe County medical examiner’s office. 
   Bystanders reportedly tried reviving Billingham with CPR before emergency officials swooped onto the scene. After being moved to a medical tent, he was later pronounced dead. 
   “He was one of the best people I’ve ever known,” said a weepy Steve MacWithey, who claimed to be one of Billingham’s best friends. 
   An impromptu memorial in Billingham’s honor was established at the festival camp where the victim was staying, according to BBC News. 
   The festival, which ends Monday, is attended by tens of thousands of people and describes itself as “a temporary metropolis dedicated to community, art, self-expression and self-reliance.” 
   In 2017, 41-year-old Aaron Mitchell died after running into a wall of fire at Burning Man, reported the Reno Gazette Journal.
