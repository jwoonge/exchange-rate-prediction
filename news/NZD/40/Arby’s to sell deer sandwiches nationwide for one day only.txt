   Arby's is on a mission to have all the meats. 
   The purveyor of fast food roast beef sandwiches is expanding its menu nationwide for one day only. In what looks like is becoming an annual Arby's tradition, the chain will re-release their venison burger nationwide — which they debuted last fall — while also testing elk sandwiches in three states. 
   On Saturday, Oct. 21, which is towards the beginning of deer hunting season in many states, Arby's will be selling venison burgers in all 3,300 restaurants across the country. The chain did this last year for nearly a month-long period in six states and it was a big hit — some locations sold out within 15 minutes. 
   The sandwich features a thick slab of venison steak with crispy onions and a juniper berry cabernet sauce on a toasted roll. 
   This year, the company took greater pains to secure enough meat to last a little longer than 15 minutes, but with the ever-present caveat that "quantities are limited." 
   Chief Marketing Officer Jim Taylor told USA Today, "If people are interested in trying the sandwich, the only way to guarantee they can get one is to get there when we open or a little before and make sure they are in line, just like the folks last year." 
   Taylor told USA Today that production to get enough venison product from New Zealand suppliers took a year. 
   In select locations in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, Arby's will sell elk sandwiches — a popular hunting species in those states. The elk sandwich will be topped with blackberry port sauce and crispy onions. 
   There are four Arby's locations in the five boroughs. Two in Manhattan (32 East 23rd St. at Park Ave. and 611 Eighth Ave. at 40th St.) and two in Queens (6916 Metropolitan Ave and 17514 Horace Harding Expressway).
