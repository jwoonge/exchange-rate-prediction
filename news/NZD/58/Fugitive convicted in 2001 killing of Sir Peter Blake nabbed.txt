   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) â€” A man convicted in the killing of yachtsman Sir Peter Blake has been caught in Brazil after being on the run for more than 15 years, police said Thursday. 
   Civil police spokesman Walrimar Santos told The Associated Press that Jose Irandir Cardoso was picked up during a routine patrol on the river island of Marajo in the northeastern state of Para. Cardoso was detained Wednesday and was carrying his brother's identification, Santos said. 
   A statement from military police said Cardoso was detained Tuesday night. The differing timelines of his capture couldn't immediately be reconciled. 
   Police discovered Cardoso's true identity after running his fingerprints through their database. 
   Santos said Cardoso would be returned to the prison he escaped from in the northern state of Amapa. 
   Blake, an internationally famous sailor from New Zealand, was shot to death by pirates during a visit to Brazil in 2001. He was on a boat monitoring pollution in the Amazon as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. when his boat was attacked. 
   Cardoso was convicted of armed robbery and for his role in the killing. He escaped from prison soon after being sentenced to more than 32 years.
