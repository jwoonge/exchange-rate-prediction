   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) â€” New Zealand's opposition leader Bill English is quitting after losing last year's election. 
   The former prime minister told reporters Tuesday he was resigning as leader of the conservative National Party and leaving Parliament. 
   English served as a lawmaker for 27 years. He took the reins as prime minister in December 2016 after his predecessor John Key resigned. 
   At the September election, English sought to extend a nine-year hold on power for his party. On election night, he appeared triumphant after the National Party won the most votes of any party. 
   But the celebrations were short-lived. The liberal Labour Party was able to form an alliance with two smaller parties and form a government under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. 
   English served eight years as finance minister before taking the top job.
