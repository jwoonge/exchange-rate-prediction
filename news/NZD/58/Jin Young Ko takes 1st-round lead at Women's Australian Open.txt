   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) â€” Jin Young Ko made six birdies on the back nine in her LPGA Tour debut to take a two-stroke lead in the opening round of the Women's Australian Open on Thursday. 
   Ko, playing in one of the final afternoon groups at Kooyanga, carded a 7-under-par 65 to move past second-place Jiyai Shin, a fellow South Korean. 
   Asked about her goals for the week, Ko replied: "First one is make the cut, second one is enjoy." 
   Former world No. 1 Lydia Ko of New Zealand was among a large group tied for third with 68s, three strokes behind. 
   "I'm happy with where I am sitting," Lydia Ko, playing her first tournament of the year, said. 
   Among the nine others tied with Lydia Ko were Americans Mo Martin and Caroline Inglis, and Sweden's Caroline Hedwall in the second tour event of the year. 
   "It just felt easy playing golf today," Hedwall said. 
   Five-time champion Karrie Webb, who says she'll play a part-time schedule this year, shot 70. She has played only one tournament since September, a team event. 
   "I felt really comfortable out there and, if anything, I haven't felt adrenaline for a while so the ball was travelling a lot further than I was anticipating," Webb said. 
   Laura Davies and Brooke Henderson each shot 72.
