Jets sign running back George Atkinson after Elijah McGuire breaks foot
   The Jets signed running back George Atkinson and waived tight end Bucky Hodges, the team announced Sunday morning. 
   The 25-year-old Notre Dame product, who was on the Chiefs' practice squad last season and previously played for the Raiders and Browns, has seven carries for 34 yards and a touchdown in 21 games. 
   Atkinson provides some depth at running back with Elijah McGuire out indefinitely with a broken foot. McGuire is scheduled to undergo surgery sometime early next week, the Daily News learned Saturday. 
   Gang Green had been looking at free-agent running back Alfred Morris and former Giants back Orleans Darkwa as possible additions. 
   Hodges signed with the Jets in April. He inked a four-year deal with the Vikings in 2017 after being picked in the sixth round of the draft. Minnesota cut the tight end later that year and Hodges was briefly with the Panthers' practice squad.
