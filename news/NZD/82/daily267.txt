Mets' Noah Syndergaard likely to return Wednesday against Nationals
   Noah Syndergaard's “quarantine” may almost be over. 
   The Mets righthander is likely to return from the 10-day disabled list and start Wednesday against the Nationals in Washington D.C., Mickey Callaway said after the team's 1-0 win over the Pirates on Sunday. 
   Syndergaard had been diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease, a contagious viral illness that typically affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. The Mets believe he picked up the virus at a youth camp. 
   The 25-year-old (6-1, 2.89 ERA) last pitched on July 20 — a 7-5 win over the Yankees in the Bronx.
