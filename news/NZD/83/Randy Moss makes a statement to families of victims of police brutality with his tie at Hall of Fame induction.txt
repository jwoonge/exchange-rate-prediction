   Randy Moss discussed "faith, family and football" as the former wide receiver was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday night — but his tie spoke for itself. 
   The 41-year-old, now an NFL analyst for ESPN, had the names of 12 black men and women — the majority of whom were killed by police or died in police custody — embroidered in gold on his black tie: Greg Gunn, Tamir Rice, Akai Gurley, Paul O'Neal, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Sandra Bland, Akiel Denkins, Alton Sterling, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. 
   Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, not a police officer; he was later found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter by a Florida six-person jury. 
   Moss did not mention his tie or police brutality during his speech, but he explained the decision while on NFL Network after the ceremony. 
   "We all have kids. We've watched 'Spiderman' before. Unlce Ben told Peter Parker, 'With great power... (comes great responsibility).'" 
   "So, you ask me about my tie," Ross said to Ray Lewis, who was also inducted. "We all know what's going on. You see the names on my tie. Being able to use a big platform like this here at the Hall of Fame ... I wanted to be able to express with my tie to let these families know that they're not alone." 
   The first-ballot Hall of Famer — who played the majority of his career with the Vikings, as well as with the Raiders, Patriots, Titans and Niners — ranks second in receiving touchdowns (156), fourth in receiving yards (15,292) and 15th in catches (982).
