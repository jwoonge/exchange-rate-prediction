Mets fans offered free therapy by NY-based mental health company
   Feeling down, Mets fans? 
   UMA Health, a New York-based online mental health marketplace, is offering free, confidential therapy sessions to Mets fans, who have watched their team make history in all the wrong ways this season. 
   Not only did the bottom-dwelling Mets have the worst June in franchise history, they suffered the worst loss in franchise history, falling to the Nationals 25-4 on Tuesday. 
   UMA health's website has a form to fill out, including "your most difficult Mets moment." The lighthearted promotion is meant to bring attention to the important role of therapy and eliminate the stigma of seeing a therapist. 
   The injury-plagued Mets are 45-63 entering Sunday's series finale against the Braves. Oh, and Anthony Swarzak was just placed on the 10-day disabled list.
