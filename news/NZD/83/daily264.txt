Mets place Anthony Swarzak on 10-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation
   The Mets have placed reliever Anthony Swarzak on the 10-day disabled list with right shoulder inflammation, the team announced Sunday. The move is retroactive to Aug. 4. 
   "It's pretty frustrating," Swarzak admitted. "Any time you're dealing with an issue in your throwing shoulder, you've got to be cautious, and that's what I'm doing now." 
   In a corresponding move, righthander Jacob Rhame, 25, has been recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas and was available for Sunday's series finale against the Braves, though he did not pitch. He is 0-1 with a save and an 8.00 ERA in 18 games in the big leagues. 
   This is Swarzak’s second time on the DL, missing about two months with a sore left oblique after getting injured in the Mets’ second game of the season. 
   "I think with the oblique injury early on, I had to revamp my throwing program pretty quickly to come back. We all saw the results of that weren't very good, but the effort level was there,” said Swarzak, who is 0-2 with three saves and a 6.00 ERA in 22 games this season. “I think this is the end result of basically going full board directly after another injury. Luckily enough, we caught it early.” 
   The 32-year-old righthander added that he doesn’t believe the latest injury will alter his offseason program at all. 
   While Swarzak told reporters he was told there was “severe inflammation,” Mets manager Mickey Callaway said the MRI revealed “just a little bit of inflammation” and doesn’t believe the reliever will miss much time.
