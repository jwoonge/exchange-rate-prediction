   Gross. 
   If Yankee fans thought the four-game sweep by the Red Sox was disgusting, an umpire was caught on camera pulling a live moth out of his ear Wednesday night. 
   In the visitors’ dugout at Guaranteed Rate Field, Yankees trainer Steve Donohue was seen helping second base umpire Bruce Dreckman extract the bug during the ninth inning of the Yankees’ 7-3 win over the White Sox. 
   With tweezers appearing to get an assist, the moth was pulled out of Dreckman's left ear, then freed by Donohue. 
   Both survived.
