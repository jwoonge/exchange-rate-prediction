Yankees outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury underwent season-ending hip surgery
   The perpetually injured Jacoby Ellsbury underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left hip Monday to repair a torn labrum, the Yankees announced Tuesday afternoon. 
   The outfielder, who hasn't played a game this season, had the procedure done by Dr. Bryan Kelly at the Hospital for Special Surgery, and it went as expected, the team said. 
   According to the Yankees, the typical recovery time to resume "full competition" after this surgery is about six months. 
   The 34-year-old had been hopeful to win the starting job in center field out of spring training, but first suffered an oblique injury in late March, then a hip injury in early April, followed by plantar fasciitis. 
   Ellsbury — whose seven-year, $153 million deal runs through 2020 and includes a team option for 2021 and a no-trade clause — was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on May 2. 
   Ellsbury’s time in the Bronx has been a disappointment to say the least. He has a .264 batting average, 39 HRs and 198 RBI since joining the Yankees in 2014. 
   The Yankees outfield is pretty banged up with Aaron Judge out with a fracture in his right wrist, and Clint Frazier trying to get back on the field after sustaining a concussion. 
   Frazier has been limited to just 15 games this season at the big-league level, hitting .265. He first suffered a mild concussion during spring training this February, and though he was cleared to resume baseball activities by March, he still reported feeling “foggy” and occasionally experiencing a “blackout feeling.”
