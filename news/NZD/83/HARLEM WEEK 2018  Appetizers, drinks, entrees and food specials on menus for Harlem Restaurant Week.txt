    
   Dining is as much a part of Harlem Week as its many social events. And this year, from Aug. 21 through Aug. 26, the establishments participating in Restaurant Week will include Melba’s, Red Rooster and other prominent local and international favorites. In addition, it will include newer eateries — such as Little Taste of Seafood and Renaissance Harlem — that are earning points throughout the Harlem community and beyond. 
   For foodies looking to explore, cuisines will include soul food, seafood, Mexican, French, and Italian. Most establishments will offer breakfast, lunch and dinner plus brunch and specialty drink menus, in addition to appealing atmospheres, live entertainment and special events. 
   Londel’s Supper Club, 2620 Frederick Douglass Blvd. (212) 234-6114. http://www.londelsrestaurant.com 
   For more than 25 years, Londel’s has been a mainstay of the Harlem community. Londel Davis, a retired NYPD officer, credits his hands-on approach for the success of his restaurant. Londel's offers fare that combines Southern, Cajun and Continental styles of cooking, and a full-service bar. 
   “Food has to look good and taste good,” said Davis. “And we care about our customers.” 
   Guests, especially international tourists, flock to Londel's widely popular Gospel Sunday Brunch buffet, which runs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
   Dishes include baked chicken, meatloaf, salads, pasta, rice dishes, baked apples and other foods for what he calls a “health-conscious” clientele. Thanks to chef Michael Wilson, Londel’s other bestsellers are catfish, appetizers such as buffalo wings, sautéed or fried prawns, and salmon. 
   Former New York City Mayor David Dinkins and celebrities such as Mariah Carey have frequented Londel’s, but Davis said, “Our business thrives on group events, parties, repasts and celebrations.”

   Lobster ceviche, Mexican quesadillas, the Bistec y Pan (steak and bread), specialty hangar steak, chimichurri and toasted bread – its flavors are Argentinian, Chilean and Peruvian – are also favorites.
