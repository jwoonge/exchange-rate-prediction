Disney+ launch marred by glitches, slow downloads
   Disney’s new streaming service got off to a bumpy start Tuesday morning. 
   The highly anticipated Disney+ launch seemingly overwhelmed the Mouse’s servers, as anxious fans were met with technical problems and glitches almost immediately. 
   “The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our high expectations,” Disney+ said in a statement around 10 a.m., hours after users began reporting problems. “We are working to quickly resolve the current user issue. We appreciate your patience.” 
   At the very least, the error messages were appropriately themed: Mickey Mouse and Pluto in space outfits or Ralph and Vanellope from “Wreck-It Ralph.” 
   Disney+ launched Tuesday in the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands with about 500 movies and 7,500 episodes of TV, including the “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian" and a live-action remake of “Lady and the Tramp.” The streaming service will expand to Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico on Nov. 19 and into Europe on March 31.
