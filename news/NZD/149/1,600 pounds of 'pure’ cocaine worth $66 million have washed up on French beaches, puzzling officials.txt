   More than 1,600 pounds of cocaine worth $66 million have washed up on French beaches — puzzling officials about how it got there. 
   The drugs — which are mostly 83% “pure” — have washed up on beaches spanning the Atlantic coast, BBC reported, leading the beach closures. 
   Police have warned people against hunting for the drugs, and from touching it as the substance is potentially dangerous because it’s so pure, Le Parisien reported. 
   Philippe Astruc, prosecutor of Rennes which is the capital of Brittany, said the cocaine likely comes from South America, BBC reported. 
   In a statement, the prosecutor’s office in Rennes said discoveries "must be reported immediately to the police or gendarmes [paramilitary police] without touching [the drugs],” BBC reported. 
   It’s not the first time officials have seen cocaine land on beaches. 
   In September, a brick of cocaine was found along a Florida beach as Hurricane Dorian made its way toward the U.S. 
   Nearly $2 million of cocaine washed ashore in New Zealand in August. Police believed the incident was related to a shipment destined for Australia, after officials saw occupants on an inflatable boat dropping packages into the ocean.
