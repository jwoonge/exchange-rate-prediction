   A routine Friday flight from Melbourne, Australia, to Wellington, New Zealand, nearly became a journey of doom. 
   The Qantas-owned Boeing 737 had to make an emergency landing at a New Zealand military base that left hungry, overheated passengers stranded on the plane for four hours, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corportation. 
   After an on-board mechanical issue was detected, pilots decided to land at Ohakea military base, located about 90 miles north of Wellington. 
   Airline officials refused to allow passengers to disembark until customs authorities — who were two hours away — were on site. 
   Social media posts show disgruntled passengers waiting four hours to finally exit the jet before reaching their final destination by bus. 
   “Sitting on the tarmac in the sun, getting extremely hot in the plane,” wrote Twitter user Ryan Newington. “Many passengers visibly distressed. . . . Customs apparently driving up from Wellington (2 hours away), not sure there’s much point, we’ll all be roasted by then.” 
   Another flier joined in the chorus of gripes, claiming the plane’s interior was sweltering. 
   “There was no air conditioning so it was unbearably hot and people were getting very agitated,” explained passenger Annette Parkin. “It was just like they dropped responsibility for us.” 
   The flight carrier did, at least, issue an apology to the passengers for the monumental inconvenience. 
   Qantas, which celebrates its 100-year anniversary next November, is the third-oldest active airline in the world.
