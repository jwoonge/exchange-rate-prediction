   It turns out all you need to win the streaming wars is a low price, a multiplatform PR blitz and the weight of one of the world’s biggest media companies. 
   At least that’s how Disney+ got it done, racking up 10 million subscribers in just one day, according to an announcement Wednesday. 
   That massive total came despite technical glitches, which Disney attributed Tuesday to unexpectedly Hulk-sized demand. 
   The Tuesday launch of Disney+, available for either $7 per month or $70 per year, was limited to the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands, with expansions coming to Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico on Nov. 19 and the rest of Europe on March 31. 
   Disney+ is also available for a seven-day free trial and is free for a year for some Verizon customers, which may have goosed that 10 million number. 
   Still, 10 million people is a lot of people. For example Hulu, which launched 12 years ago and which Disney also has a controlling stake in, boasted 28 million subscribers in May. Disney had previously forecast that Disney+ would have 60 million to 90 million subscribers to the streaming service, which includes legendary and less-than-legendary old Disney films, Marvel and Star Wars franchise spin-offs, original content and more, by 2024. 
   Netflix, which also launched its streaming platform in 2007, announced last month it had 158 million subscribers across the globe.
