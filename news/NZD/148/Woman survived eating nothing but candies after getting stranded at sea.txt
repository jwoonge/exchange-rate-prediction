   Who said candy is bad for you? 
   A woman from New Zealand who got stranded at sea managed to survive for nearly two days while eating nothing but candy, according to the New Zealand Herald. 
   Kushila Stein, 47, made do with a handful of lollies she had with her for 37 hours until she was rescued. 
   “I still have one lolly left, mum," Stein told her mother after being saved, according to the newspaper. 
   Stein was assisting a man, only identified as Mike, in a trip to bring a yacht to Athens, Greece, from southern Turkey. She made a detour three weeks into the trip to check out a mountain along a nearby coast last Friday, but when she tried to return, her boat was forced off its path by winds. 
   She had no water with her and only the boiled candies to eat. Stein made use of three plastic bags, which she wrapped parts of her body with in order to stay warm when the sun went down. 
   A search was launched Saturday morning, and Stein was recovered on Sunday afternoon in an area about 55 nautical miles off of Crete’s northern coast.
