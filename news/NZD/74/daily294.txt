Mets select outfielder Jarred Kelenic with sixth overall pick
   The Mets selected OF Jarred Kelenic with the sixth overall pick in the 2018 MLB Draft on Monday night. 
   Here’s a breakdown of the Mets’ first-round pick: 
   Jarred Kelenic 
   Position: OF 
   School: Waukesha West, (Wis.) HS 
   Age: 18 
   Bats: Left 
   Throws: Left 
   Height: 6-1 
   Weight: 196 lbs. 
   What you should know: Kelenic is rated as one of the best pure hitters in this draft. As a high school junior, Kelenic earned MVP honors in the 2016 Pan America games for the USA U18 team. Kelenic possesses great speed and an elite arm, which could lead to him moving from center field to right once he starts his pro career. Scouts praise Kelenic's plate approach and vision, which are especially strong for a cold-weather prep hitter. The main question for Kelenic is whether he can develop major league power on a smaller frame, but he hit two home runs in only nine games for the USA U18 team.
