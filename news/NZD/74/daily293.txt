SEE IT  Michael Irvin on Donald Trump asking for NFL players' pardon recommendations  'Are you joking?'
   The Playmaker thinks the president is sidestepping several issues. 
   Former Cowboys’ wide receiver Michael Irvin appeared stunned when he caught wind of Donald Trump’s latest ploy: to have NFL players who feel the justice system is unfair recommend names of people for POTUS to pardon. 
   “And that should help with the issue of killing innocent people?” Irvin told independent journalist Adam Glyn. 
   Trump, all of a sudden infatuated with the idea of granting pardons, even suggested doing so for Muhammad Ali, even though the legendary boxer’s infamous conviction for refusing to report to military duty in the Vietnam War was overturned by the Supreme Court over 40 years ago. 
   The Hall of Famer Irvin hasn’t been afraid to chime in on the contentious relationship between players and Trump. 
   Irvin in April told TMZ it was a “damn shame” that Eagles players were boycotting a visit to the White House...and you know how that eventually turned out. 
   Back in September, Irvin said on “The Dan Patrick Show” that it was sad to see Trump “divide the country” through sports.
