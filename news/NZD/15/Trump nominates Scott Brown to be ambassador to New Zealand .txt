   WASHINGTON — Scott Brown may soon be headed off to greener pastures. 
   President Trump announced his intent to nominate Brown to be the next U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand on Thursday, offering him a plum ambassadorship to the kiwi country after Brown's vocal 2016 campaign support. 
   Brown, who served as senator from Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and nearly winning a Senate seat there, was a vocal surrogate for Trump during the GOP primaries. And while he criticized some of Trump's decisions during the general election, he remained a steadfast supporter. 
   Brown is also a former Army National Guardsman, Fox News contributor, attorney — and one-time Playgirl model.
