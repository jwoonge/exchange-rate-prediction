UFC star Ronda Rousey engaged to Travis Browne
   Ronda Rousey has officially pinned down her man. 
   The UFC superstar is engaged to her boyfriend of two years, heavyweight Travis Browne, TMZ Sports reports. 
   Browne, 34, reportedly popped the question to his Olympic bronze medalist girlfriend under a waterfall in New Zealand last week because "it felt like the right place to do it," and Rousey, 30, was spotted rocking her bling on Thursday. 
   Rousey is currently ranked as the UFC's No. 4 female bantamweight fighter in the world, and gained fame when she became the first female fighter to sign with the UFC in 2012. Prior, she snagged an Olympic bronze medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics in judo. 
   The star, who has dabbled with an acting career in films like "The Expendables 3" and "Furious 7," notoriously suffered the first loss of her MMA career in November 2015 to Holly Holm, who pulled off a shocking upset in UFC 193. When Holm beat Rousey, Rousey was the women's bantamweight champion at the time. In January, UFC President Dana White said Rousey's fighting career was "probably done." 
   Browne, meanwhile, is a mixed martial artist who began his career in 2009. 
   This will be the first marriage for Rousey, and the second for Browne, who officially confirmed the pair's relationship in 2015 following a messy divorce from his wife, Jenna Renee Webb. 
   "Dating is for children. Dating is for kids. Over the summer, through all the s--t that I had to shuffle through, that I had to sift through, Ronda and I started talking throughout the summer and I'll say now that we are together," he said at the time. "She's my woman and I'm her man. There's no boyfriend, girlfriend stuff. There's no dating. We're together."
