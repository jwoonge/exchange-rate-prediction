Did a Seal Eat Your Vacation Photos? A New Zealand Scientist Is Looking for You
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Krista Hupman, a biologist in New Zealand who studies the feces of leopard seals, knows they can contain surprises like feathers, fish bones and birds’ feet. But on Wednesday, she described “definitely the weirdest” find yet: a USB drive containing photos and videos of a tourist’s vacation.
Now Dr. Hupman, a research scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, wants to reunite the USB drive with its owner.
The seal scat, Dr. Hupman said, was collected from Oreti Beach in the Southland region of the South Island of New Zealand in November 2017, and frozen for a later study of the animal’s diet. Two volunteers defrosting the fecal matter last month discovered the thumb drive and called Dr. Hupman.
“They said: ‘You won’t believe what we’ve found,’” she recalled.
On the memory stick — discovered intact and with the cap still on — were images of wildlife taken at Porpoise Bay, almost 60 miles from where the scat was collected, but no identifiable human faces. Some images included a blue kayak, which the researchers hope might be recognizable to the stick’s owner.
