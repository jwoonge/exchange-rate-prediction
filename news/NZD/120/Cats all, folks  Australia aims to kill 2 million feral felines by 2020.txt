   It might be a dog-eat-dog world, but in Australia, it’s more like man-kill-cat. 
   The nation’s government has installed an ambitious plan to cull 2 million feral felines by 2020, reported CNN on Friday. The country’s entire wild cat population is believed to be somewhere between 2 million and 6 million. 
   In Queensland, the state council is pushing the gruesome offer of a $7 bounty for ever feral cat scalp, which the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, unsurprisingly, slams as “cruel.” 
   Even in nearby New Zealand, one prominent environmentalist has proposed a cat-free future, with both domestic and feral cats either controlled or euthanized. 
   “We are not culling cats for the sake of it. We are not doing so because we hate cats,” said national commissioner of threatened species Gregory Andrews. “We have got to make choices to save animals that we love, and who define us as a nation.” 
   Cats are believed to have arrived Down Under in the 17th century. But after more than 300 years, their numbers have skyrocketed, and now it’s believed they occupy 99.8% of the country. 
   Feral cats are virtually the same as domesticated cats, except they roam the wild and hunt for food. 
   Andrews claimed to the Sydney Morning Herald that since the introduction of cats, about 20 indigenous mammal species have been driven to extinction. That makes them the biggest threat to Australia’s native species, in which about 80% of its mammals and 45% of its birds can be found nowhere else on Earth. 
   Australian cats likely kill more than 1 million native birds and 1.7 million reptiles every day, a spokesperson for Australia’s Department of the Environment and Energy told CNN. 
   Species under threat from cats include the brush-tailed rabbit-rat and golden bandicoot.
