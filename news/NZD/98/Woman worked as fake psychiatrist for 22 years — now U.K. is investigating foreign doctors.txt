   A New Zealand woman worked in the U.K. as a fake psychiatrist for 22 years, even changing a patient’s will. 
   Zholia Alemi, 56, falsely claimed to have a medical degree from the University of Auckland in 1995 and tried to inherit $1.67 million from a patient, whom she stole watches from, by making herself a beneficiary. 
   Her case has prompted The General Medical Council to launch an urgent investigation into thousands of foreign doctors in the U.K. 
   The backgrounds of 3,000 doctors will be checked. 
   “We recently became aware that Zholia Alemi used a fraudulent qualification to join the medical register in 1995 and worked as a doctor until June 2017,” Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, said in a statement Sunday. 
   Alemi — who failed out of school in 1992 — was arrested in 2016 and suspended from the medical register on June 23, 2017. 
   She has been serving a five-year prison sentence since October 2018. 
   The prison sentence was declared after Alemi made herself a beneficiary to a dementia patient’s will, the BBC reports. 
   “Our processes are far stronger now, with rigorous testing in place to ensure those joining the register are fit to work in the UK,” Massey explained. 
   “Patients deserve good care from appropriately qualified professionals and place a great deal of trust in doctors. To exploit that trust and the respected name of the profession is abhorrent.” 
   Police and agencies, like NHS England, have been notified and will take action to help patients as needed. 
   The GMC apologized for allowing this to happen. 
   “It is clear that in this case, the steps taken at the time she joined the register were inadequate and we apologize for any risk arising to patients as a result. We are confident that, 23 years on, our systems are robust and would identify any fraudulent attempt to join the medical register,” the council said.
