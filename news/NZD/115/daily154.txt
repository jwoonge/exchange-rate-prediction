Targeting guns  Massacre moves New Zealand to rapidly limit firearms, something America never does
   Less than 72 hours after a Friday afternoon massacre that took 50 innocent lives and wounded 50 more, the cabinet of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern took up strengthening gun control measures on Monday, saying “our gun laws will change.” 
   The firm resolve to act against weapons of war down under in Wellington puts to shame the inaction in Washington despite a vastly larger body count in America. 
   Across this country, again and again schools are shot up, children’s bodies riddled with bullets, and again and again Congress does nothing to restrict access to firearms. Fear of the National Rifle Association lobby paralyzes the capital. 
   The killer in Christchurch had two semi-automatic rifles, which he used to spray bullets like a wall of lead as though water from a hose. Point and kill. 
   Such rapid fire is not needed for hunting or self defense in the Southern or Northern hemisphere. These instruments are designed for warfare with the object to kill as many persons as quickly as possible. 
   Two mosques crowded for Friday noon prayers were only battlefields in the gunman’s demented mind. 
   Limiting or banning civilian access to semi-automatic guns will not stop murderers and madmen (this killer had three other single-shot long guns) but will reduce the death toll. 
   While sport shooters and collectors and homeowners can have firearms, their rights are not without limits, particularly when the rights of others to live are at risk. 
   So as New Zealand moves with determination to protect its people, the United States only waits for the next bloody massacre.
