   2018 NBA Rookie of the Year and 76er Ben Simmons may be far from his home down under, but still found a way to support his country’s heroes from afar. 
   During the Sixers’ Tuesday night game against the Hornets, the Australia native was spotted wearing bright yellow kicks with the words “EGG BOY” etched on the side of them. “Egg Boy” referred to the nickname given to the 17-year-old Will Connolly, the protester who on Saturday, smashed an egg on Australian senator Fraser Anning’s head while he spoke to press after a right-wing rally. 
   Anning had made despicable remarks following the Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand, blaming the tragedy on Muslim immigration, accusing the religion of Islam of being violent. 
   Connolly’s actions were in response to Anning’s speech. After the egg incident, Anning and his supporters attacked the teen, strangling and punching him in front of multiple press and cameras. Authorities said the altercation was under investigation. 
   Simmon’s support of young protesters on his apparel isn’t out of the norm for the NBA All Star. 
   Around the same time last year Simmons dawned a March For Our Lives t-shirt during a March 24 Sixers versus Timberwolves game.
