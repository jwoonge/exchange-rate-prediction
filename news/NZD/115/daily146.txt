Stephen Colbert’s surprise ‘Late Show’ trip to New Zealand canceled following mosque shootings
   A surprise trip to New Zealand for Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” was nixed in the aftermath of the horrific mosque shootings in the country last week, the late-night host revealed Monday. 
   Colbert said they planned to go there Wednesday to film for a week. 
   "If you’ve never been, go,” Colbert said of New Zealand on his CBS program Monday. “It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world, and the people there are unbelievably kind and welcoming. Obviously, we’re not going to go down now, but we hope to go down in the future. 
   "Again, we just want to say to everybody down there how sad, how heartbroken we are for what that country is going through,” he continued. 
   Fifty people were killed in mass shootings last Friday at a pair of mosques in Christchurch. 
   An Australian man who claimed responsibility for the attack spouted anti-immigrant and hate-filled language in a 74-page manifesto he posted online before the shootings. 
   Colbert on Monday described New Zealand as a “wonderful, isolated country so far away from the problems that we take for granted" in countries above the equator. 
   “Now this very particular brand of evil has infected that country,” Colbert said.
