   Brenton Tarrant, the man accused of gunning down dozens in a massacre at a New Zealand mosque last week, reportedly intends to represent himself in court. 
   Richard Peters, who represented Tarrant in court Saturday, told the New Zealand Herald that he will no longer be representing the accused killer. 
   "What did seem apparent to me is he seemed quite clear and lucid, whereas this may seem like very irrational behavior," Peters said. "He didn't appear to me to be facing any challenges or mental impairment, other than holding fairly extreme views." 
   Peters told the Herald that Tarrant didn’t tell him why he was firing his lawyer but “he thinks the job would be done better himself.” 
   Tarrant, 28, has claimed responsibility for the mass shootings at a pair of mosques in Christchurch, where 50 were killed and another 50 were wounded. 
   A manifesto linked to the alleged gunman, who Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as an “extremist, right-wing, violent terrorist,” claims that he had been planning the attack for two years. 
   The writing, titled “The Great Replacement,” also claims that the writer intended to incite violence and create “an atmosphere of fear” for Muslims.” 
   Earlier Sunday, a counter terrorism unit raided the Sandy Beach house of Tarrant’s sister and his mother’s boyfriend. 
   Tarrant has been charged with one count of murder so far, but more charges are expected when he reappears in court on April 5.
