New Yorkers mourning over New Zealand massacre hold interfaith vigil at Queens mosque
   New Yorkers of all faiths united in a Queens mosque Sunday to mourn the victims of the New Zealand terror attack. 
   "Terrorism is indeed our common enemy," Imam Shamsi Ali told the dozens of people who gathered at the Jamaica Muslim Center on 168th St. near Highland Ave. in Jamaica Hills two days after 50 people were killed in a New Zealand terrorist attack. 
   “We are not intimidated,” Ali told the crowd. “We are not fearful." 
   Ali led an interfaith prayer with Rabbi Marc Schneier, then chastised President Trump for not explicitly condemning racism after the attack in Christchurch Friday. 
   White supremacist Brenton Tarrant, 28, released a manifesto praising Trump as an inspiration for his hate before killing dozens of Muslims. 
   “We are very deeply saddened by what had happened in New Zealand,” said Ali. “Why is it so difficult for our president to speak up and say (Tarrant) is our enemy?” 
   The faith leaders were joined by Queens Councilman Rory Lancman, who said the massacre had "particular meaning here in New York City, for all of us who come from every corner of the world." 
   "Hatred, intolerance and bigotry knows no limits, no bounds,” Lancman said. “It affects all of us.”
