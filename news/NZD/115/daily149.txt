Man who swiped flag from roving 'Trump  Build the Wall' ad in Chelsea released without bail
   A man accused of stealing an American flag from a float bearing a“Trump: Build the Wall” sign walk out of court Monday without posting bail. 
   Jared Handler, 37, charged with criminal mischief, possession of stolen property and marijuana possession, allegedly snatched the flag at Eighth Ave. and W. 14th St. around 6:30 p.m. Sunday. 
   The roving float attached to a van is the work of Robert Cortis, according to papers filed in Manhattan Criminal Court. 
   Cortis drew intense criticism last Friday for driving the sign in Cleveland during a vigil organized by religious groups to mourn people killed at two mosques in New Zealand. 
   Back in New York, Cortis told the NYPD that Handler had taken a flag from his vehicle. 
   In court on Monday, the district attorney said Handler told police that he wasn’t trying to steal anything, he was just trying to break it off. 
   Handler had marijuana on him when he was arrested, according to court documents.
