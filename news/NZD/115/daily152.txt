'Egg Boy' to donate GoFundMe money to New Zealand massacre victims
   Supporters inspired by the egg crack seen ‘round the world have cracked open their piggy banks in support of “Egg Boy.” 
   Egg Boy, whose real name is Will Connolly, became an international hero of sorts last week after breaking a raw egg on the head of an Australian senator who blamed the New Zealand mosque attacks on immigration. 
   The 17-year-old boy’s viral prank happened at a live news conference with Australian Sen. Fraser Anning, who used the mosque attacks to push an anti-immigrant agenda. 
   Connolly, who appeared to record himself smashing the egg on Anning’s head, was then punched twice by the senator. The teen was then tackled and subdued by Anning’s supporters. 
   The GoFundMe, titled “Money for EggBoi,” said the money raised would go toward legal fees and “more eggs.” 
   More than 2,000 people have donated over $50,000 to the online fund-raiser. 
   An update posted to the GoFundMe on Sunday said Connolly plans to donate “a majority” of the money to Christchurch and included screenshots of messages from the teen. 
   “I’m under strict instructions to limit my posts on social media I’m sorry,” Connolly said in a message to the GoFundMe’s creator who had asked the teen to verify the fund-raiser on his own social media. 
   In an effort to not “profit from crime,” the vigilante egg smasher said money should go to the victims, as well. 
   After Saturday’s incident, the teen was taken away by police and later released without charges, but police said they were still investigating.
