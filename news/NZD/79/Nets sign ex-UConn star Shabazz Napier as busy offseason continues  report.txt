   The Nets’ busy offseason continues. 
   Former UConn star Shabazz Napier is headed to Brooklyn after signing a two-year deal Saturday, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The contract includes a team option on the second year. 
   The 27-year-old enjoyed a career season with Portland in 2017-18, averaging 8.7 points and 20 minutes per game. 
   Napier joins a young group of guards that just lost Jeremy Lin. 
   The Nets on Thursday dealt Lin to the Hawks for a 2020 second-round draft pick and the rights to 2016 second-round pick Isai Cordinier. 
   They also sent Isaiah Whitehead to the Nuggets in a separate deal for Kenneth Faroed, Darrell Arthur, a 2019 protected first-round pick and a future second-round pick.
