Knicks sign Mitchell Robinson, second round pick, following solid Summer League debut
   Mitchell Robinson is in for a payday fresh off his solid Summer League debut. 
   The Knicks second round pick, 36th overall, inked a multi-year rookie contract Sunday, the team announced. 
   The organization didn’t immediately disclose details of the contract, though ESPN reports it’s for four years, $6.5 million. 
   Robinson, who was a bit of a mystery man entering the draft after never suiting up at Western Kentucky where he enrolled, played in his first competitive game in over a year Saturday. 
   The 7-foot center dropped nine points and picked up eight rebounds to go alongside four blocks and six fouls in 28 minutes in the Knicks’ 91-89 win over the Hawks. 
   “I felt like when (Kevin Knox and Mitchell) are working together in a situation that’s a very dangerous situation for the other team,” coach David Fizdale said after the game in Las Vegas. “If they can touch the paint now it’s a jumping contest. And if you see from that game right there both of them are pretty athletic.”
