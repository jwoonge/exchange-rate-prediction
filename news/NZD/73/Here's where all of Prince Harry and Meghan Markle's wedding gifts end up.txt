   Members of the royal family are not allowed to accept gifts from businesses that may "exploit" them later on. 
   Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly received over $9 million worth of wedding gifts for their May 19 nuptials — but most of them are going back to the likely luxurious businesses from which they came. 
   That’s because royal protocol dictates that members of Britain’s most noble family should never put themselves in a position where a company might “exploit the gift for commercial purposes.” 
   “Gifts, including samples, should always be returned unless it is not justifiable to do so on the grounds of cost,” the royal website reads. 
   The Duke and Duchess of Sussex must also turn down gifts from people they don’t know; meaning you can expect those Tiffany champagne flutes back on your doorstep any day now. 
   “Gifts offered by private individuals not personally known to the Member of The Royal Family should be refused,” according to the site. 
   But Prince Harry and Markle announced before the wedding in April via Kensington Palace that in lieu of gifts, the couple would appreciate a donation to charity instead. Prominent well-wishers like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull all followed suit, making charitable contributions to various aid organizations. 
   The newlyweds are currently far away from gift sorting and repackaging. Prince Harry and Markle are honeymooning at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge in Alberta, Canada, according to TMZ, relaxing in the “Royal Retreat” cabin.
