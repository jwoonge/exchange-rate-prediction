Support for New Zealand's Labour jumps ahead of election but lags behind National, poll shows
   WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Support for New Zealand's opposition Labour party jumped six points, according to a Newshub poll released on Sunday, showing the center-left party lags the governing National party ahead of elections but is threatening its decade-long hold on power. 
   National slipped 1.1 points to 43.3 percent, while Labour hit 39.4 percent, after a change in leadership boosted the party's chances in the Sept. 23 election. 
   Support for the nationalist NZ First Party, which either party will likely need to form a coalition government, fell 2.6 points to 6.6 percent. 
   The New Zealand dollar was largely unchanged after the poll was released, hovering above three-month lows at $0.7154.
