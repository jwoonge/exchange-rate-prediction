   Country singer Don Williams died at age 78, his publicist said Friday. 
   The Floydada, Texas-born singer-songwriter reportedly passed away after a short illness. 
   In 1964, he formed the folk band The Pozo Seco Singers while living in Corpus Christi. 
   The group later disbanded, and Williams moved to Nashville, where he recorded his chart debut, "The Shelter of Your Eyes," in 1973. 
   His hit "I wouldn't Want To Live If You Didn't Love Me" topped charts the following year. 
   From 1974-1991, each Williams single hit the Top-40 on the Billboard Country charts. 
   His chart-topping hits from the 1970s include "Tulsa Time," "She Never Knew Me," and "It Must Be Love." 
   The songs were popular internationally — he developed a following in England, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and Kenya. 
   In 1978, Williams was named Male Vocalist of the Year by the Country Music Association. 
   He also made appearances in two movies — 1974's W.W. and The Dixie Dancekings and 1980's Smokey and the Bandit II. 
   Williams' biggest hit was 1981's "I Believe In You," which topped Country charts and made it to No. 24 and the Hot 100. 
   His music's mellow sound earned him "The Gentle Giant" moniker. 
   Williams routinely performed sold-out shows through the 2000s. 
   In 2010, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. 
   He gave his final performance in 2016. 
   "It's time to hang my hat up and enjoy some quiet time at home," he said in a statement at the time. "I am so thankful for my fans, my friends and my family for their everlasting love and support."
