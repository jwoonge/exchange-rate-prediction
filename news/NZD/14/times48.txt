Canada Today  Commemoration, Dining Tips and Marijuana
Each week, Canada Today mixes The Times’s recent Canada-related coverage with back stories and analysis from our reporters, along with opinions from our readers.
The route my father followed across Windsor, Ontario, to visit my grandmother on Sundays took us down Ypres Avenue. We passed near other streets with names that seemed unusual to me as a child, among them: Verdun, Lens, Somme and Arras avenues. Eventually, I learned that they were one of Canada’s many memorials to World War I.
Cycling trips to Europe and covering the Tour de France has given me the privilege of seeing those places with the names that once puzzled me.
In 2001, while near Verdun, I stayed in a hotel along the Voie Sacrée, the road that in 1916 delivered troops and supplies to the front while under constant bombardment. Uniquely for a regional road in France, it is officially known by its name rather than letters and numbers. The kilometer markers that measure it are topped with reproductions of French World War I helmets. And there are commemorative marches on the road to the site of the front by soldiers and citizens alike.
The centennial of World War I has more recently brought the Tour de France back to the sites of some of those famous battles. In 2014, the race traveled along a highway where the grass alongside had been replaced by pale blue cornflowers to evoke the jackets worn by French troops. Graveyards and memorials, many impossibly vast and all impeccably maintained, have been backdrops for the race. So have the forests that have grown out of the ground pockmarked with shells fired long ago. Unexploded ordnance make many of those forests off limits.
Last Saturday evening, I went down to the national war memorial in Ottawa to watch an overnight vigil to a battle, which, over the last century, has become particularly important to Canadians: the Battle of Vimy Ridge. It was the first in World War I in which the country’s troops fought solely as Canadians. They overran a German line that had defied attacks by French and British forces.
As I write, debate continues over whether Vimy marks a critical moment in Canada’s development as an independent nation. But the deaths of nearly 3,600 Canadians in that battle remain part of the national memory. Events throughout the country last weekend and a gathering of about 25,000 people at the Vimy monument in France attest to that.
It is a stark contrast to the United States. Commemorations of the centennial of America’s entry into the war last week were few and received very little notice. But while the United States was a latecomer — Canada joined at the outset, in 1914 — it lost 116,516 soldiers. And while Canada rather discreetly celebrates a victorious battle, Australia and New Zealand commemorate the bloodbath that was Gallipoli.
We’d like to know your thoughts about why memories of World War I remain so strong in Canada 100 years later. Email us at canadatoday@nytimes.com.
Last Sunday, when I returned to the vigil at 1 a.m., the crowd was long gone except for a photographer with a tripod and the occasional passers-by from the bars nearby. But the nearly 3,600 electric candles placed there were still lit and rotating shifts of army cadets were carrying out the memorial in the chilly night air.

Canada Today Dining Special I recently asked readers of this newsletter to nominate restaurants in their communities and in Canada generally that are memorable or distinctive. We received a torrent of replies, all of them interesting and many of them involving little-known dining spots. We cannot publish everything. But we have put together a selection. My favorite is a former snack bar at a tiny airport south of Montreal. And, speaking selfishly, most of your suggestions are in a price range that won’t challenge The Times’s expense policies. Thank you again to everyone who submitted suggestions.
