A 19-year-old girl was trampled to death on the staircase at an overcrowded house party
   A 19-year-old student attending a house party in New Zealand was crushed to death on a staircase, where revelers were pushing and shoving in every direction. 
   The victim, identified by Kiwi news outlet Stuff as Sophia Crestani, became buried under an avalanche of bodies Saturday night as partygoers trying to make their way up a staircase reportedly succumbed to those trying to make their way down, resulting in more than four dozen students crashing to the floor. The tragedy occurred at The Manor dormitory in the city of Dunedin. 
   “They started to fall backwards and when the people at the top started falling it was kind of like dominoes – everyone went down and the people at the bottom of the stairs just ended up in a pile of people,” a witness told Stuff. 
   Partygoers were still trying to force their way into the home around midnight when police arrived, according to that appalled observer. Rescue workers unraveled the twisted bodies to find Crestani fatally injured and two other people seriously injured. 
   Crestani, who leaves behind a twin sister, was remembered by a former educator as “a cheerful, positive and personable young woman,” who mentored other students. She was also a dressmaker. 
   The weekend’s fatal soiree was a going-away party for the 114-year-old party pad, which was losing its lease to the University of Otago, according to Stuff. The five-bedroom, bi-level home reportedly had a history of hosting parties. There were said to have been “hundreds” of attendees at the home on the night Crestani died. 
   A memorial formed outside The Manor Monday morning as passersby left flowers for Crestani.
