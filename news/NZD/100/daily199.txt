New holiday ad shows Trump squarely on the naughty list
   One international airline knows at least one world leader who’s been naughty this year. 
   Air New Zealand has released a new holiday commercial that will likely prompt a Twitter tirade from its intended subject — President Trump. 
   During the airline’s seasonal ad, a bunch of kids representing the four corners of the globe who find out they’ve been placed on Santa’s naughty list assemble to think up ways of swaying Santa’s opinion. 
   Naturally, the child representing America is dressed up like Trump, wearing a suit and sporting a “Make Christmas Great Again” cap. 
   After several nations offer ways to make amends to get on the nice list, such as Argentina promising to reduce “personal gaseous emissions by 27 percent” and New Zealand promising to “do all our chores,” the kiddie-Trump shares his thoughts. 
   “I have to say, I’m not naughty at all. In fact, I’m the nicest person I know,” he utters to raucous laughter from the other children. 
   “Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK.” 
   It’s a direct dig at Trump’s September speech at the United National General Assembly, where he claimed his “administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history” of the United States. 
   After various chortles and guffaws from the assembly members, a clearly ruffled Trump offered the same response: “Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s OK.”
