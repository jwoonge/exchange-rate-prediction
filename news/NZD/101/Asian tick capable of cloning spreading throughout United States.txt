   The Asian longhorned tick has already been seen in nine states, The Journal of Medical Entomology reported. A wide swath of areas in the country are also said to have extremely favorable and suitable habitats for it. 
   While there have been no reports of an active disease transmission in the U.S., in its native range it has been linked to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which can be deadly. 
   “In other countries, bites from these ticks can make people and animals seriously ill,” according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
   The species is believed to have spread with such rapidness, in part, because of the female’s ability to clone themselves. 
   Up to thousands of ticks may be found at a time, or on an animal, the CDC said. 
   Areas with the “highest ranked suitable habitat” were on the coast, according to the study. 
   The Journal of Medical Entomology also suggested that the tick has been in the United States for a number of years and it will be impossible to eradicate given its ecological adaptability and ability to clone itself. 
   Until recently the species was found in its native range to China, Japan and Korea, as well as in extreme southeastern Russia and parts of Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands. 
   The tick feeds on humans, in addition to domesticated and wild animals including pigs, deer, cats, dogs and rats. 
   The first detection in the United States was found in New Jersey in 2017, the study said. It has since been found in Arkansas, Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, according to the CDC.
