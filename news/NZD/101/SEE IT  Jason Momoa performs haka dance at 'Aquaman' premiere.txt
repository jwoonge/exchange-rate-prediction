   Jason Momoa made a splash at the premiere of “Aquaman” by performing a ceremonial Maori war dance, the haka. 
   The Hawaii-born actor — who stars as Aquaman in the highly anticipated superhero movie — led the way as he and others took part in the dance on the blue carpet at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Wednesday. 
   The cool moment was captured on camera and shows Momoa performing the haka alongside a group that included his two children, 11-year-old Lola and 9-year-old Nakoa-Wolf. 
   At one point in the nearly three-minute video, which was shared online by Variety, Momoa can be seen breaking his character’s signature gold trident on his knee as part of the dance. 
   This comes a little over a year after Momoa was part of a group that performed the haka inside an Australian gym as a tribute to mixed martial artist Mark Hunt, a friend of the actor who hails from New Zealand. 
   “Aquaman,” which also stars Amber Heard, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Willem DaFoe, dives into theaters on Dec. 21.
