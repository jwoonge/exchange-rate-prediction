   A conniving British art dealer who hawked Picassos and other pricey pieces while ripping off clients for $10 million couldn’t brush off a 12-year prison sentence. 
   Timothy Sammons, 63, admitted to several counts of grand larceny and scheme to defraud when he pleaded guilty on July 2. In exchange for the plea, he was to sentenced Tuesday to a four-to-12 year term in Manhattan Supreme Court. 
   Prosecutors said that between 2010 and 2015, Sammons — through his Upper East Side-based company Timothy Sammons Fine Art Agents — brokered deals for clients and either “misled them” about the timing of sales or “failed entirely” to tell them that he had sold their pieces and then pocketed the profits. 
   Sammons, who was once employed by Sotheby’s, was arrested in 2017. Among the works of art involved in the shady transactions were versions of Pablo Picasso’s “Buste de Femme” and Marc Chagall’s “Reverie.” 
   His victims, which includes at least four clients, were in New York, London and New Zealand. 
   “The emotional harm and financial harm done to the victims of this crime is very serious,” Justice Ann Scherzer said. 
   Sammons used the money he stole for private club memberships, luxury travel accommodations and credit card payments, according to Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance.  
   “When brokering the sales of high-priced, one-of-a-kind paintings, Timothy Sammons had lying, scamming, and stealing down to a fine art,” Vance said in a statement. 
   Sammons’ lawyer, David Touger, said in court that while his client concedes he took money, he “denies using any of the funds for his own personal enjoyment.” He said the looted cash was used for business purposes. 
   At his sentencing, a remorseful Sammons said he was "extremely sorry for all the trouble it’s caused people,” adding that it “was not my intention to cause any grief at all.” 
   Sammons is expected to get deported to the United Kingdom upon his release.
