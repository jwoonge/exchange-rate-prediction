   Fatherhood may have put Britain’s Prince Harry over the moon, but his concern for planet Earth will stop him and wife Meghan Markle from having more than two children. 
   This is what he told the Duke of Sussex told Jane Goodall, the renowned environmental activist and chimpanzee expert, in an interview for British Vogue. 
   In a conversation about sustainability, climate change and the future we are leaving for our children, Harry said that although he had always felt concerned for the planet, being a father had made that more acute. 
   “It does make it different,” he said, adding that he has “always had a connection and a love for nature” and has “always wanted to try and ensure that, even before having a child and hoping to have children.” 
   “Not too many!” Goodall said with a chuckle. 
   “Two, maximum!” Harry said. “But I’ve always thought: this place is borrowed. And, surely, being as intelligent as we all are, or as evolved as we all are supposed to be, we should be able to leave something better behind for the next generation.” 
   Goodall noted that some of that damage has already been done. 
   “But, in fact, we’ve stolen their future,” she said. “Not all of it. But we’ve got to try and pay a little of it back. And get together to try and heal some of the harm, and at least slow down climate change.” 
   The interview was part of the September issue, which Markle guest-edited. 
   The annual fashion issue this year is titled “Forces for Change,” and highlights 15 influential women, from teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern and former First Lady Michelle Obama, who Markle interviewed herself.
