There is the first full moon of autumnRising through the gums Slanting up the river valleySpreading silver on the river’s whirls.The moon humbles my candle And seduces an owl to call. The moonlit gums become full of silky boughs and velvet shadowsAnd every leaf stands individual and clear, Every boulder gains a distinct shadow and The river glows like mercuryAs it sluices through the buttongrass sedge. The Earth tilts and time passes; There is no going back to summer. This is the time to reflect and make amends. This is the first full moon of autumn, Rising above the eucalyptus trees, Slanting up the river valley, Spreading lightKnowingly.
