Aaron Judge hits another milestone in Yankees injury rehab
   Aaron Judge is back doing Aaron Judge things. 
   In batting practice, at least. 
   The injured slugger (fractured right wrist) went deep during five rounds of batting practice Monday in Minnesota, ahead of the Yankees matchup with the Twins, according to multiple reports. 
   It was the first time Judge took BP on the field since he landed on the DL July 27. 
   Judge took BP in the cage over the weekend while the Yanks were in Seattle. 
   “I haven’t had no setbacks, no nothing like that, so I am just excited to get this progression rolling," Judge said Sunday. 
   Judge also said Sunday he expects to play “meaningful games down the stretch.” 
   There’s no question the Yankees could use No. 99’s bat. 
   The Yankees entering Monday night’s game were hitting .248 with runners in scoring position, which ranks 20th in MLB.
