Joe Benigno to return to WFAN this week
   Joe Benigno is returning to the WFAN airwaves. 
   The co-host of the station’s midday show with Evan Roberts will be back on the air 10 a.m. Monday following nearly a two-month leave of absence, The News’ Bob Raissman reports. 
   "Joe Benigno will be back on WFAN Monday at 10 A.M. Don’t know how Entercom suits (they own FAN) will position his return or if the lawsuit filed by a former employee, who charged JB with sexual harassment, has been settled," Raissman posted to Twitter on Saturday. 
   Former WFAN sales executive Lauren Lockwood in a July $5 million lawsuit accused the 64-year-old Benigno of sexual harassment, including openly bragging about threesomes and making unwanted advances. 
   It’s unclear whether the explosive lawsuit has been settled. 
   Benigno, through his agent Mark Lepselter, “categorically denied” all allegations in the lawsuit, The News previously reported. 
   “This isn’t a good look to say the least,” one advertising executive told The News’ Raissman in July. “Does a company want its brand, attached to the deviant perception the lawsuit has created?”
