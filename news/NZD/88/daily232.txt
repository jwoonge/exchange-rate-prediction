Yankees call up pitcher Chance Adams
   Another chance. 
   The Yankees called up pitcher Chance Adams on Wednesday, the team announced. 
   Adams, ranked the organization's No. 13 prospect by MLB.com, will provide bullpen support for the Bronx Bombers after manager Aaron Boone was forced to go to through three relievers during Sonny Gray’s spot start Tuesday night, a dismal 10-5 loss to the Twins. 
   The 24-year-old Adams made the switch to the bullpen with Scranton Wilkes-Barre Triple-A after a brief August stint in the majors. 
   Adams made his big-league debut in a 4-1 loss to the Red Sox, giving up three earned runs in five innings. He struggled in relief three weeks later, surrendering three earned runs in 1.2 innings. 
   But it appears Adams has finally gotten used to his new role. 
   “I think he’s really started to look comfortable, each outing more and more,” RailRiders manager Bobby Mitchell said last week, according to the Times Leader, after Adams picked up his first save. “I think he’s really started to look comfortable, each outing more and more." 
   Adams needed only 12 pitches, nine of which were strikes, to retire the side in a 3-0 win over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. His pitches reached the mid-90s, the Times Leader reported.
