   Saquon Barkley largely lived up to the hype in his NFL debut, injecting pizzazz into a lifeless Giants squad midway through the fourth quarter of his regular season debut. 
   But a botched punt from Kaelin Clay late in the game spoiled Barkley’s 68-yard run, his and Pat Shumur’s Big Blue debuts and the return of Odell Beckham Jr. as the Giants on Sunday fell to Jacksonville, 20-15. 
   Jaguars linebacker Myles Jack scored on a 32-yard interception return early in the fourth quarter to put Jacksonville ahead for good. 
   Blake Bortles threw a short touchdown pass and led two other first-half field goal drives. The Jaguars dominated with the exception a Barkley-induced hiccup in opening a season by living up to the Super Bowl hype. 
   Held in check much of the game, Barkley brought the sellout crowd to its feet shortly after the Jack touchdown with a spectacular 68-yard run aided by a great block by receiver Sterling Shepard. It got New York within five with 10:39 to play. 
   New York went for the 2-point conversion, but Barkley who picked up 106 yards on 18 carries, was stopped. 
   It proved costly when passes of 19 and 21 yards to Beckham, who finished with 111 yards on 11 catches, got the Giants to the Jacksonville 34. Instead of attempting what could have been a tying fourth field goal from Aldrick Rosas, Eli Manning (23 of 37 for 224 yards) threw a fourth-down incompletion. 
   Giants backup running back Wayne Gallman left the game in the second half with a knee injury.
