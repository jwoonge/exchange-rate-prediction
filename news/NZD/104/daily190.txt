'World's loneliest duck,' Trevor, killed in dog attack
   In the end, it wasn’t isolation that killed him. 
   Trevor the Duck — dubbed the world’s loneliest duck for being the only such waterfowl on the South Pacific island country of Niue — has died in an apparent dog attack. 
   A Facebook page dedicated to Trevor first noted that he was missing on Jan. 23. Two days later, the page broke the news of his tragic death. 
   “We’ve had confirmed reports that Trevor the Duck — Niue has died,” the Jan. 25 post reads. “He was seen dead in the bush after being attacked by dogs.” 
   The bird is believed to have flown or blew onto the island in a storm last year and made a puddle on the side of a road his home since there are no major bodies of water there. He “won the hearts of so many locals and tourists, he became a global celebrity and promoter of Niue,” the Facebook page states. 
   Rae Findlay, who’s head of Niue's Chamber of Commerce and updates Trevor's Facebook page, told BBC News that it’s likely that Trevor arrived from New Zealand or a nearby Pacific island. 
   Locals looked out for the duck, often stopping by to feed him or make sure his puddle had enough water.
