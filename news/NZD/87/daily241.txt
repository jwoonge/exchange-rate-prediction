Todd Frazier admits he fooled just about everyone with diving catch
   Todd Frazier should take his talents to Broadway. 
   The Mets third baseman duped the umpires and just about everyone else Monday into believing he made a highlight reel catch. 
   Well, he didn’t, as SNY’s Steve Gelbs uncovered. 
   “It is Hollywood,” Frazier told reporters Wednesday. "Sometimes you've got to act out a little bit." 
   Let’s recap. 
   Frazier dove into the stands Monday to grab a foul ball off the bat of Alex Verdugo. Upon getting up, the veteran infielder lifted up what everyone thought was the ball. 
   Newsflash: It wasn’t. 
   It was instead a rubber ball Frazier snagged, with a fan being seen on the broadcast coming away with the real one. 
   But no one else noticed as he threw it back into the crowd. 
   "I was trying to get out of there as quick as possible," Frazier said. "I saw someone pointing at the right ball and I was like, 'All right, I'm just going to have to play this off.' I got in the dugout and was telling people I was flabbergasted that I even got away with it."
