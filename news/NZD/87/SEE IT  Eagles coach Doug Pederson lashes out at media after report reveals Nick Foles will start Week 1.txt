   Cry about it, Doug. 
   Eagles coach Doug Pederson lashed out at the media Sunday for revealing his quarterback plans to start the season. 
   In case you missed it: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport broke the news a day earlier that reigning Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles would start Week 1 against the Falcons. 
   “I appreciate y’all putting words in my mouth this week,” he said, referencing the report. “Therefore, I’m not going to discuss it. 
   “Next question. Next question. Next question,” Pederson repeated when pressed on the matter. 
   Pederson later admitted Wentz, who is still rehabbing a torn ACL and LCL that cost him the end of his season, had not been cleared for contact. 
   The scene, though, had already appeared hostile and at least two members of the media didn’t hold back. 
   “We’re asking a fair question,” one countered. 
   “What’s the point of this?” another asked. 
   Then Pederson doubled-down. 
   “It’s my decision,” the second-year coach said. “I’m trying to win a football game. And I don’t want to put my game plan out there for everybody to see it and read it — and teams can scheme. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense.”
