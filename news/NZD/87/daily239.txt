Eagles fans burn infamous '0 Super Bowls' jersey once famously worn by Giants fan 'License Plate Guy'
   Eagles fans can kiss goodbye the jersey that drove them crazy for years. 
   The infamous “0 Super Bowls” jersey is no more after fans burned it before their team’s Week 1 18-12 win over the Falcons on Thursday night. 
   Lifelong Giants fan Joe Ruback, otherwise known as “License Plate Guy,” used it to torture the rival fanbase for years before selling it to Eagles fan Eric Emanuele for $10,000 a few months after the Philadelphia’s first Super Bowl win last season 
   "That jersey would make my teeth grit and my fists clench," Emanuele said back in May, according to NorthJersey.com. "It did what it was supposed to do: drive Eagles fans nuts and made steam come out of my ears. We won the Super Bowl, it was time to get that jersey and burn that thing in the parking lot." 
   “License Plate Guy” shared the moment on Twitter as Eagles fans had a party.
