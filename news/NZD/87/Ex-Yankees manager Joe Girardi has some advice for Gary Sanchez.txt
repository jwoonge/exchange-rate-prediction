   Gary Sanchez oughta listen to his old skipper. 
   At this point, it can only help. 
   Joe Girardi offered some tips for his former player a day after Sanchez’s lousy defense resulted in two past balls alongside Luis Severino during an ugly 8-2 loss to the Athletics on Wednesday. 
   “Over the next four weeks, I’d try to fix his base,” Girardi said Thursday on MLB network’s “High Heat” with Chris “Mad Dog” Russo. “It’s his base, the left knee collapses and he’s not in a position to catch some of these balls and block some of these balls.” 
   Girardi, of course, is no stranger to publicly criticizing Sanchez’s defense after doing it a bunch last season, his final as Yankees manager. 
   But Sanchez’s woes only continue to frustrate the Bronx Bombers. 
   Sanchez’s 13 passed balls this season is tied with the Astros’ Martin Maldonado for most in the league, though he’s only played 71 games to this point. 
   He led the AL last season with 16 passed balls last season in 122 games. 
   With the Yankees holding just a 3.5-game lead over the A’s for the first Wild Card spot, perhaps Sanchez should heed the now-MLB Network analyst’s advice.
