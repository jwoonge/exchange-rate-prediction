   For once, a meaningful Mets game in September at Citi Field. 
   David Wright’s next step in rehab from multiple back, neck and shoulder surgeries will include a workout Friday and a simulation game at Citi Field on Saturday, manager Mickey Callaway  told reporters after the Mets 7-3 win over the Dodgers. 
   The 35-year-old team captain, who re-joined the big-league club earlier this month but remains on the disabled list, hasn’t played since 2016 but holds hope he will return to the lineup at some point. 
   Wright has gone 7-for-41 (.171) in 12 minor league games this season split between Single-A St. Lucie and Triple-A Las Vegas. 
   John Ricco, a part of the Mets front office triumvirate, in late August said Wright “hasn’t been able to make some of the benchmarks that were laid out for him (as he began his rehab stint).” 
   Bringing Wright back to Flushing had more so to do with a MLB rule. 
   The Mets had two options: Send Wright back to Port St. Lucie to continue rehab or have him join the big-league club on a DL stint.
