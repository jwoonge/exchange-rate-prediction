   The turnover continues. 
   The Giants signed defensive tackle John Jenkins and waived Romeo Okwara in a corresponding move Tuesday. 
   Jenkins, 29, announced his signing on Twitter before the team made it official later in the afternoon. 
   “I want to thank the @ChicagoBears fans and organization for my time in the family. Today I begin a new chapter with the #BigBlue nation & happy to announce my signing with @Giants !!,” Jenkins posted. 
   Jenkins, who will likely serve as backup to Damon Harrison, was drafted by the Saints but spent the last season in Chicago where he racked up five tackles and three assists in eight games. 
   Okwara totaled one tackle and two assists in six games.
