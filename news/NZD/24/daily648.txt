Lorde compares friendship with Taylor Swift to suffering from autoimmune disease
   Lorde's bizarre simile about Taylor Swift forced the singer to apologize â€” but not to Swift. 
   In a wide-ranging interview with The Guardian, Lorde compared being friends with Swift to "having a friend with very specific allergies." 
   "There are certain places you can't go together. Certain things you can't do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship," she said. "It's like having a friend with an autoimmune disease." 
   Lorde and Swift have been friends for years, with the New Zealand native running in the "Red" singer's group of celebrity gal pals. 
   But the strange comparison caused backlash about not Swift, but about Selena Gomez, who suffers from lupus. 
   After a fan called Lorde out for the "incredible ignorant analogy," the "Royals" singer apologized on Twitter. 
   "I f--ked up & that was really insensitive," she tweeted. "I'm sorry." 
   Gomez revealed her diagnosis in October 2015, when she told Billboard that she'd gone through chemotherapy. 
   The chronic autoimmune disease can attack any part of the body, including joints and organs. 
   Gomez did not respond to the comment.
