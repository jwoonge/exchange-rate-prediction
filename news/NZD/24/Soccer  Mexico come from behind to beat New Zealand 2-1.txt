   SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Mexico scored twice in a busy second-half performance to overcome New Zealand 2-1 and destroy the All Whites dreams of securing their first Confederations Cup victory at the 11th attempt. 
   New Zealand had the better of the first half and went in 1-0 up thanks to a nice goal from Chris Wood. 
   But Mexico stormed back after the break and Raul Jimenez got the equalizer nine minutes into the second period. 
   Javier Aquino dribbled in from the left and after an exchange of passes on the edge of the New Zealand box, Jimenez spun to fire high into the net. 
   Mexico took control of the game and Oribe Peralta grabbed the winner from close range after 72 minutes when he swept home another incisive cross from Aquino. 
   Mexico ended the day as Group A leaders with four points, ahead of Portugal on goal difference. Hosts Russia are in third with three points and New Zealand have none.
