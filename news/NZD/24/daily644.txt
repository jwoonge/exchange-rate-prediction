SEE IT  Kayakers witness 20-minute-long battle between octopus and seal
   The octopus had eight arms but no chance in hell. 
   In the process of bringing a few tourists in kayaks around Kaikoura, New Zealand, a tour guide captured a battle between a massive male seal going at an ornery octopus attempting to avoid getting eaten. 
   Conner Stapley was taking his group to Kaikoura's beautiful South Bay only to have them witness the methodical murder of a mollusk, as a fur seal dragged the octopus up from the bottom of the ocean to the surface, where it proceeded to tear its arms off in front of the tourists. 
   "It is quite rare to see something like this and rarer at this time of day," said Stapley. "Normally you would see New Zealand fur seals feeding in the evenings." 
   The guide admitted that he thought a battle might be brewing when he spotted sea birds gathering close by, already checking out the action. 
   "That is normally a sign there is something happening," he said, "and then the fight began." 
   It would last for 20 minutes. 
   However, despite the octopus' signature suction cup-like features, it could only hang for so long before it eventually became just another meal for this particular seal.
