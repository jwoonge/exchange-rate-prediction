   The Jets made a couple roster moves ahead of their final preseason game. 
   Wide receiver Lucky Whitehead, who didn’t practice last week or play against the Giants on Friday due to an undisclosed injury, was waived/injured, the team announced Sunday. If unclaimed, the former Cowboy will immediately become a free agent. 
   Gang Green also inked former Wake Forest quarterback John Wolford on Sunday. The undrafted free agent was one of 44 tryout players to take part in Jets rookie minicamp back in May. 
   The move gives Todd Bowles’ squad insurance heading into its preseason finale against the Eagles on Thursday. Starters usually don’t suit up in their team’s last tune-up before the regular season gets underway. 
   Wolford led the ACC with 29 passing touchdowns and interceptions last season. 
   Whitehead didn’t make headlines with the Jets as opposed to his time in Dallas. 
   The 26-year-old was cut by Dallas after he was charged with shoplifting in what was later deemed a case of mistaken identity. 
   The charges against Whitehead were later dropped as it was found a man used Whitehead’s identity to steal $40 worth of food and from a convenience store in Virginia last summer. 
   Whitehead, a kick and punt returner specialist, did not suit up with the Jets last season.
