Ex-Jets WR Eric Decker retires after short stint with Pats
   Eric Decker is hanging ’em up. 
   The best free-agent signing of former general manager John Idzik’s short tenure, Decker called it a career Sunday after a short preseason stint with the Patriots. 
   “It has been my childhood dream and my passion to play the game of football,” Decker posted on his Instagram account. “This has been a passion inside of me since I was a little boy but I know now it is time to hang my helmet up and start a new chapter in my life.” 
   It didn’t appear Decker, who signed with Bill Belichick’s squad earlier this offseason, would have made the Pats regular season roster after struggling heavily during the preseason. 
   The 31-year-old dropped a pass in each of his last two preseason games and caught just 2-of-5 targets from backup quarterback Brian Hoyer in the Pats’ 25-14 loss to the Panthers on Friday. 
   Even so, Belichick seemed optimistic about Decker eventually bouncing back. 
   “I think Eric’s learned everything well,” Belichick said Saturday on a conference call, according to NESN. “Again, he had a background in this system in Denver with (offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels) and he’s played multiple positions in the offense since he’s been here. We used a couple new formations last night so I don’t think learning is really a problem for him and he has a lot of experience of some of the more sophisticated routes, option routes and things like that are all things that he’s done.” 
   Decker, one of the league’s most underrated receivers during his eight-year career, played three seasons with the Jets, putting up 19 touchdowns to go alongside 163 receptions in 33 games with Gang Green from 2014 to ’16. 
   He was released by the Jets last summer before signing with the Titans. He spent the first four seasons of his career establishing himself as a solid option in Denver.
