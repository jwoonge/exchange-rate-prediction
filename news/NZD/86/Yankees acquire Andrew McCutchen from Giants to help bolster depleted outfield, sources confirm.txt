   The Yankees are beginning to return to full health, but that didn’t stop Brian Cashman from making a deal for another bat to help bolster a depleted outfield. 
   Andrew McCutchen is headed to the Bronx in exchange for a package of prospects,a source confirmed to The Daily News’ Kristie Ackert. 
   A package of prospects, including 23-year-old shortstop Abiatal Avelinio, is headed to the Giants, according to multiple reports. 
   Avelino has split this season between double-A and triple-A. 
   McCutchen will provide much-needed outfield depth for a team missing Aaron Judge due to a broken wrist. 
   Yankee right fielders have been abysmal at the plate since Judge went down, ranking last in batting average, 29th in on-base and slugging percentages, according to ESPN. 
   The 31-year-old 2013 NL MVP is slashing .255/.357/.415 alongside 15 home runs and 55 RBI in 130 games this season. 
   This is a breaking story. Check back for updates.
