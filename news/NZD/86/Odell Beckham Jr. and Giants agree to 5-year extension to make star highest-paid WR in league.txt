   Odell Beckham Jr. is finally getting paid. 
   The Giants and their star receiver have agreed to a $95 million mega contract extension ($56.5 million guaranteed), The Daily News’ Pat Leonard learned early Monday. The team made the contract official Monday evening. 
   “Honestly, I don’t even know how to explain it,” Beckham, who will be available to the media Tuesday, told Giants.com. “I don’t know if it’s a relief, I don’t know – it’s a combination of everything. You’ve worked all your life to get to this point and it’s finally here. I have to thank Mr. Mara, Steve Tisch, Mr. Gettleman, coach (Pat) Shurmur, Eli (Manning), all the guys I played with in the past years.” 
   Last summer, the enigmatic receiver voiced his desires in an “Uninterrupted” video to become the top earner, period, in the league. 
   But he ended up settling for that accolade at his position, eclipsing the Steelers Antonio Brown who inked a four-year, $68 million extension last February. 
   Beckham Jr.’s deal comes out to $18 million per year. 
   “It’s a five-year extension, six years total,” GM Dave Gettleman said. “We got him until he’s 108. I never worried whether or not we would get it done. I’m pleased, because the litmus test for a contract is that neither side is ticked off before the ink can dry, and neither side should be ticked off. It’s a very fair deal.” 
   The 25-year-old Beckham Jr. played in just four games last season after undergoing season-ending ankle surgery. 
   Heading into training camp, it was speculated whether he’d hold out. 
   But Beckham Jr. didn’t and it’s about to pay off in his favor.
