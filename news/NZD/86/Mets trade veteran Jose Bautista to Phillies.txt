   The Mets on Tuesday traded veteran Jose Bautista to the Phillies for a player to be named later or cash considerations, marking the second trade between these two teams this season. 
   “It’s about doing the right thing by Jose,” interim GM John Ricco said during a conference call, as the 37-year-old Bautista will now have a chance to compete for a playoff contender. 
   The move will also allow more at-bats for Michael Conforto and Brandon Nimmo. 
   Meanwhile, Bautista hit .204 alongside nine home runs and a solid .351 OBP in 83 games with the Mets after a short stint earlier this season with Atlanta. 
   The teams had until 1 p.m. Tuesday to get a deal done after Philly claimed the veteran outfielder off revocable trade waivers earlier this week. 
   That left the Mets triumvirate with three options: Either work out a trade with the Phillies, give him up for free, or pull him off waivers all together. 
   But the two sides got it done like they did last month, when the Mets sent infielder Asdrubal Cabrera to the Phillies for pitching prospect Franklyn Kilome. 
   Brandon Nimmo was in the lineup for the Mets’ game against the Cubs Tuesday night, batting eighth and playing right field. 
   He was activated off the disabled list after suffering a bruised left index finger from taking a pitch off the hand earlier this month during a doubleheader against the Phillies. 
   Nimmo missed 11 games, a stretch in which the Mets went 6-5. 
   With Bautista being shipped to the Phillies, Nimmo will likely be the everyday right fielder for the duration of the season if he proves to be fully healthy.
