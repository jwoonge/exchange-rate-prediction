   The Lord has returned — in a carved version, at least. 
   Two statues of Jesus Christ that had been stolen from a New Zealand church this week reappeared at a cemetery just one day after surveillance photos of the ungodly theft went viral on social media. 
   The images showed a man and a woman shamelessly carrying the statues from inside the Carmelite Monastery in Auckland to a car that was parked right outside just before 7 a.m. Friday, according to a Facebook post by Johanna Keil-Penn, a community member who helped spread the word about the theft. 
   Her post was shared more than 10,000 times before police found and returned the statues to the church on Saturday. 
   “We thank you all so much for your help,” she wrote. “This means a lot to us. The statues are a little bit damaged but can be fixed.” 
   The items were described as a Most Sacred Heart of Jesus statue that had been with the church since 1940 and a Little Infant of Prague statue that was taken from a chapel. 
   The thieves have yet to be found, according to the New Zealand Herald. 
   The outlet said this was the third time the church has been robbed this year.
