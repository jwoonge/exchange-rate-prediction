   Hold out hope, Knicks fans. 
   There’s still a slight chance LeBron James will fulfill every Knicks fans’ dream and bring a title to New York before he eventually hangs ‘em up. 
   Astrophysicist — and expert on just about everything — Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks The King will play until he’s at least 38. 
   “When you get older, you get wiser, so you can spend less energy exploring because you already know the answer to where your teammate is going to be,” deGrasse Tyson told TMZ over the weekend. “You can pass it off and enable the talent of others. 
   “40 is pushing it.” 
   Hello, Decision 4.0. 
   LeBron, of course, signed a mega-four-year, $153.5 million deal with the Lakers this offseason. 
   But arguably the greatest ballplayer of all time has made it known he’d like to suit up to play with his oldest son, LeBron Jr, who would be entering the league once his father hits 39-years-old. 
   So, um, maybe they’ll suit up together in MSG? 
   Just a thought.
