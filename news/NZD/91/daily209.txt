Yoenis Cespedes to undergo second heel surgery next month; the latest on the Mets OF
   Yoenis Cespedes surprised just about everyone by showing up to David Wright night. 
   It looks like it’ll be a while before the slugger takes Citi Field again. 
   The Mets outfielder is scheduled to undergo surgery to his left heel on Oct. 23 and isn’t sure how much he’ll play in 2019. 
   "I think it's unpredictable given what will happen and I can't say I will play X, Y, Z amount of games," Cespedes told reporters Sunday through an interpreter. 
   He added he may be able to resume baseball activities around February. 
   Because Cespedes' status is uncertain, Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon says the team must plan in the offseason as though the two-time All-Star will be unavailable. 
   Cespedes underwent surgery on his right heel last month — both procedures are meant to remove bone calcification from the heels. 
   "I feel very good. Even better than I was expecting," he said regarding his first surgery. 
   Cespedes, who is on the books until 2020 with a hefty $29.5 million salary, was limited to just 38 games this season. He hit .262 with nine home runs and 29 RBI.
