   Jets wide receiver ArDarius Stewart may kick off his sophomore NFL season with a PED suspension. 
   NFL Network reported Friday that Stewart is facing a two-game ban for violating the league’s performance-enhancing substance policy. He reportedly tested positive for a diuretic, or masking agent. 
   Stewart, the Jets’ third-round pick in last year’s NFL draft, told the Daily News last month that he was looking to improve on his quiet rookie season and catch his coaches’ attention in a crowded receiver room. 
   “I’ve just been learning,” Stewart said. “I hope I’ve been showing the coaches what they’ve been wanting to see this year in how I’ve been practicing and how I’ve been moving. So, we’re going to see.” 
   That plan may now see a delay with league discipline reportedly looming. 
   Stewart caught six passes for 82 yards along with seven rushes in 15 games last season.
