   An Amber Alert has been canceled after a baby who was abducted in Queens was found. 
   Police said the abduction took place at a hotel converted into a family homeless shelter near the Van Wyck Expressway and 91st Ave. in Queens at 9:55 p.m. Friday. Police said a man took the child after an argument with the tot’s mother. 
   Word of the abduction sparked an Amber Alert for the abducted child. 
   But the 8-month-old infant, August Pippins, and her dad, Jerome Pippins, were located in good physical condition at 8:15 a.m. Saturday in Harlem. 
   A pedestrian saw Pippins take his daughter into his mother’s home on Frederick Douglass Blvd. 
   Pippins, 24, was arrested and charged with burglary, acting in a manner injurious to a child and custodial interference, cops said. 
   Little August was brought to Harlem Hospital for observation.
