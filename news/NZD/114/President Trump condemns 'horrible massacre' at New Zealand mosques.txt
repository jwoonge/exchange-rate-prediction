   President Trump denounced the “horrible massacre” in New Zealand after at least 49 people lost their lives in shootings carried out at a pair of mosques. 
   Both Trump and the White House expressed support for the people of New Zealand in the aftermath of the horrific attacks in Christchurch. 
   “My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques,” Trump wrote in a tweet Friday morning. “49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!” 
   The White House shared a similar sentiment in a statement released by press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, calling the shootings a “vicious act of hate.” 
   “The United States strongly condemns the attack in Christchurch,” Sanders said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.” 
   The shootings occurred Friday at the Al Noor mosque, where 41 people died, and the Linwood Mosque, where seven were killed, according to authorities. Another person died in the hospital. Others sustained injuries that range from minor to critical. 
   The mosques are located only a few miles apart. 
   "It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. 
   One man has been arrested and charged with murder. Four people were detained, but police have said one arrest was not in connection with shootings.
