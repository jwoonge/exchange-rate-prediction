Donors can research the organization or charity before offering help by checking the website Charity Navigator, which grades charities based on transparency, accountability and financial health.

• A crowdfunding page set up by Victim Support New Zealand for victims of the shootings had raised more than 2.6 million New Zealand dollars (about $1.7 million) from some 32,000 donors by Saturday evening. The charity has also collected another 81,000 New Zealand dollars on a second page it set up when the volume of traffic overnight Friday appeared to temporarily overwhelm the first.
• United for Christchurch Mosque Shootings: This Muslim crowdfunding page had raised about 1.29 million New Zealand dollars from about 22,000 donors by Saturday evening.
• The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, where 18 people were killed in a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in October last year, invited donations to support the Muslim community of Christchurch after what it called a “senseless act of hate.”
• The New Zealand-based politics and culture website The Spinoff lists several more funds and events in aid of the shooting victims.
