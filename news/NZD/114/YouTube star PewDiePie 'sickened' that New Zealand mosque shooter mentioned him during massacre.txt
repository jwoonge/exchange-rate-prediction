   Swedish YouTube star Felix (PewDiePie) Kjellberg said Friday he was “sickened” to hear that the shooter in the New Zealand mosque attacks mentioned his name during a live stream of the rampage. 
   “Just heard news of the devastating reports from New Zealand Christchurch,” he wrote on Twitter. “I feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person. My heart and thoughts go out to the victims, families and everyone affected by this tragedy.” 
   Kjellberg, who has more than 89 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, is a controversial comedian and gamer who has previously faced backlash for anti-Semitic messages and even Nazi imagery posted in his videos. In one video, he played the Nazi party anthem while bowing in front of a swastika. 
   In 2017, he apologized for using the N-word on a live stream. 
   The gunman in New Zealand apparently asked viewers to subscribe to Kjellberg’s YouTube channel during a now-deleted Facebook live stream of the shooting. 
   “Remember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie,” the terrorist said. 
   The shootings took place at two mosques in and near Christchurch, killing at least 49 people and injuring dozens of others. 
   The 29-year-old comedian has more than 20 billion views on his YouTube videos.
