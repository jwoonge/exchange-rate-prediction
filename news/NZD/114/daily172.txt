Cardozo High put on lockdown after report of man with gun; NYPD arrests one person
   Benjamin Cardozo High School in Bayside was put on lockdown Friday afternoon after a report of a man possibly armed with a gun outside the school, police said. 
   Cops said one person was in custody but no charges had been filed. 
   Education Department spokeswoman Miranda Barbot said no students or staffers were hurt and the lockdown was soon lifted. 
   “A serious allegation was immediately reported to the NYPD, who conducted a thorough search and swiftly recovered a BB gun,” Barbot said. 
   Word of a man with a gun circulated outside the school at about 2 p.m. as classes were winding down for the week. At least one person who tweeted that he had a brother at the school referenced the shootings at mosques in New Zealand that left dozens dead during prayer services. 
   “Oh hell nah not even a day after the NZ shooting I get an alert that someone is wanted for possession of a firearm near my little bros school,” the man tweeted. ”I mean it's Queen's so it's probably some idiot waving a gun around but honestly I'm paranoid now.” 
   Another person at a Starbucks near the school tweeted that cops were “everywhere.” 
   “no dozo kids anywhere which is weird for a Friday,” the person tweeted. “I look at citizen (app) and there’s a search for someone...with a gun and dozo’s on lockdown.”
