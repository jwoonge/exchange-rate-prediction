Heroic stories emerge from New Zealand mosque shootings
   An elderly man was fatally shot after throwing himself in front of a fellow worshiper. 
   A survivor risked his life tackling the gunman and taking one of his weapons. 
   Those are just two of the heroic stories that emerged from the horrific terrorist attack in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday. 
   One of the survivors, Syed Mazharuddin, said he watched as a heavily armed gunman shot at people around him, killing at least one of his friends. At one point, Mazharuddin told the New Zealand Herald, one of his friends “saw an opportunity and pounced on” the shooter, taking away one his weapons. 
   “The hero tried to chase and he couldn't find the trigger in the gun,” Mazharuddin told the Herald. “He ran behind him but there were people waiting for him in the car and he fled." 
   Another man, Omar Nabi, was not at the scene, but he was told Friday his father died trying to shield another person from the bullets. Daoub Nabi, who was 71, was a generous man who would often go to the airport to greet incoming refugees, his son told NBC News. 
   “He’s helped everyone who’s a refugee,” Omar Nabi said, according to the network. “Whether you’re from Palestine, Iraq, Syria — he’s been the first person to hold his hand up.” 
   His father was among at least 49 people killed in what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as “one of New Zealand’s darkest days.” 
   Mazharuddin described the gun snatcher as “a young guy who usually takes care of the mosque.” His heroic act likely saved lives as it briefly stopped the shooting. 
   A police officer was also praised for dragging the gunman from his car while armed with just a handgun. The suspect was later arrested and charged with murder.
