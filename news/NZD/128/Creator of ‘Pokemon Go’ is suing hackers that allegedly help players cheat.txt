   This case might Pokemon Go to trial.  
   Niantic, the creators of “Pokemon Go” and the upcoming “Harry Potter: Wizards Unite” mobile games, filed a lawsuit against a hacker collective, accusing them of infringing on their intellectual property. 
   According to the suit, Global++ sells what it calls “tweaks” to Niantic games that give players an unfair advantage. 
   Niantic filed the suit in the run-up to its newest game, “Harry Potter: Wizards Unite,” being released in the U.S. after successful beta testing in Australia and New Zealand in the spring. 
   “Niantic files this motion on the eve of the United States launch of Harry Potter, the culmination of a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment by Niantic, the success of which is threatened by [Global++] unlawful conduct,” the company said in a motion for a preliminary injunction, according to Business Insider report. 
   In seeking an injunction, Niantic hopes to avoid disaster when it launches its Harry Potter game, which it accuses Global++ of already developing, according to the report. 
   Niantic and WB Games are holding an event Tuesday at Universal Studios Hollywood where launch details are expected to be revealed. 
   PokemonGoHub.net reported that Global++ took down its website, deleted its servers on chat app Discord, and announced “we will be shutting down indefinitely incompliance [sic] with our legal obligations.”
