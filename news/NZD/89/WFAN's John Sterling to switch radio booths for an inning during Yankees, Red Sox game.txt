   John Sterling better get to work on his Red Sox home run calls. 
   Yes, you read that right. 
   The long-time Yankees radio broadcaster will spend the fourth inning of Tuesday's game in WEEI's Red Sox Radio Network booth while Boston peer Joe Castiglione takes his place alongside Suzyn Waldman, Newsday reports. 
   Castiglione has been with the Sox since 1983, while Sterling of course hasnâ€™t missed a game in almost three decades. 
   The Yanks, barely clutching onto a 1.5-game lead over Oakland for the top American League wild card spot, will try to prevent Boston from clinching the division at the Stadium this week.
