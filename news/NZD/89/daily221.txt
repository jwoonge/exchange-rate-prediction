Mets cut new radio deal with WCBS-AM
   Entercom now owns the radio rights to the city's two baseball teams. 
   The Mets have cut a deal with WCBS-AM, the team announced on Monday, ending a five-year relationship with WOR-AM. 
   The News in July speculated Howie Rose and Josh Lewin would remain the radio voices of the Mets through a station move seeing as the team has the final say over their announcers. 
   The Mets made the move from WFAN to WOR in 2014. Entercom merged with CBS radio in 2017.
