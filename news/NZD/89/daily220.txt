SEE IT  Jets RB Isaiah Crowell wipes butt with football during TD celebration
   Well, at least it wasnâ€™t another butt fumble. 
   Isaiah Crowell celebrated his second touchdown Thursday night by wiping his behind with the ball and tossing it into a crowd of Browns fans. 
   Bonus points for creativity, although coach Todd Bowles was probably beside himself. 
   The Jets were issued a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
   Crowell of course spent four seasons in Cleveland before signing on with Gang Green.
