   You've got the wrong Zane, Twitter trolls. 
   NFL fans meant to go after Zane Gonzalez the Browns kicker on social media after costing his team eight points — two field goals and two extra points — and their first win in 631 days. 
   But they instead blew up the phone of a University of Rio Grande baseball graduate assistant who happens to go by the same name. 
   "Guys, I'm just a college baseball coach. Relax," the non-Browns kicker later posted to Twitter. 
   While the Browns kicker is on Twitter, though you may want to give the guy a break. After all, ESPN reported Tuesday that the Browns will switch kickers following the brutal 21-18 loss to New Orleans on Sunday. 
   "It's on me 100 percent," Gonzalez said after the game. "I can't be too mad at myself because I'm the one that did it, you know what I mean? I can't blame it on [anybody] else. It sucks because we were so close to that win, and it's been so long. I just let everybody down." 
   The Browns face off against Sam Darnold and the Jets this Thursday.
