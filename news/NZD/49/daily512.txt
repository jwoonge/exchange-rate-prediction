SEE IT  Tony Stewart gets into scary wreck during race in New ZealandÂ 
   Former NASCAR driver Tony Stewart was driving in a dirt sprint car race in New Zealand Tuesday when he got into a scary crash. 
   Motorsport Moments shared a video of the wreck that happened at Robertson Holden International Speedway. Stewart ended up crashing when he tried to move up in the race from the back of the field, according to the track's website. 
   When Stewart went to round a corner on the dirt track, his car drifted and made contact with the wall of the track. Stewart's car flipped over and spun around on the track before coming to a stop. 
   The three-time Cup Series champion was apparently alright after the crash. A Twitter user posted photos from the track that showed Stewart walking away from the car. 
   Stewart retired from NASCAR following the 2016 season, but he hasn't stopped racing just yet. The 46-year-old has been racing dirt cars ever since he chose to park his NASCAR career.
