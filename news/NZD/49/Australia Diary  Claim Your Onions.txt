Recently, I was on a morning peak hour train in Melbourne, and there was a tall, middle-aged woman sitting down on one of the disabled seats, with a young man in front of her standing up (they didn’t know each other). 
After some pointed observation, the woman spoke to the man — asking permission, I suppose. She leaned down and tied the laces on the man’s brogues, as he looked on, smiling.
I was laughing to myself. It was such a motherly thing to do.
I took this photo on December 28, 2015. 
I had just finished my degree and was about to move to Melbourne. This is practically my last memory of Sydney. 
I like it because I like to think of Sydney as it is in the photo — maybe too fuzzy sometimes, but always vibrant, hitting you with an unexpected moment of warmth.
I was riding the 345 through the northern Brisbane suburbs, my fat sack of groceries bouncing merrily on the vacant seat next to me. While in the city I'd bought myself a treat: a host of ingredients for a spicy laksa soup for one — silken tofu, light coconut milk, bean sprouts, and one loose brown onion. 
We passed Normanby, Kelvin Grove, Newmarket … and it was then that my onion went rogue. It slipped out of its packaging and bounced off the seat, under the next one, and began to roll drunkenly up and down the aisle. 
Pa-toonk. Pa-toonk. 
All eyes turned to me as we pulled in at Alderley and the onion, too, reached its resting position by the driver’s door. 
Pa-toonk-clunk! 
I detest confrontation and owning up to my mistakes more than anyone, but I knew I had to be brave. 
“Excuse me, I … I think that’s my onion!” I hobbled down to collect it like a reluctant fifth-place winner in a raffle. 
I’ve done walks of shame before but never one quite like this. I plucked it up and returned to my seat clutching my prize. We drove onward, all vegetables where they were meant to be. 
Own your mistakes. Speak up. Claim your loose bus onions.
