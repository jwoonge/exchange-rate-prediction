SEE IT  Justin Bieber shows off two new tattoos in shirtless selfie
   Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez may be over Instagram, but Bieber certainly isn't. 
   The Canadian crooner used his Instagram story Monday to flaunt two new tattoos, a soaring eagle on his stomach, and a roaring bear on his chest. 
   The "Sorry" singer, 23, showed off the new ink first in a shirtless selfie, and then in a short video. The eagle tattoo is located directly under his 'Son of God' tattoo. 
   Bieber, who recently wrapped the Australia and New Zealand dates of his "Purpose" tour, has been spotted out and about Down Under recently, hanging out at bars, the beach, and on a motorcycle. 
   The fresh ink joins his already extensive tattoo collection, which includes two arm "sleeves," several crosses, and more than 50 others.
