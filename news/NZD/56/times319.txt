Bleeding Ears and Road Trip Tears

When I was 9, I asked my dad if I could put my ‘So Fresh’ CD on as our family drove to Brisbane for a holiday.
“Hannah… one thing I need you to learn is that the people singing your yahoo music are temporary… Jimmy Barnes is forever.”
I really could not for the life of me piece together what he was talking about, but all I knew was the man on the CD sounded like he was going to pop a blood vessel every time the track hit a chorus. 
It didn’t really matter though, because as long as we were stopping at Goondiwindi McDonald’s in two hours and then hopefully getting a pie and a strawberry milk at whichever servo deemed most suitable four hours after that, I could take on anything… even listening to Paul Kelly’s greatest hits.
Ten years on and it is with great sadness that I admit to having more than four Spotify playlists that contain a song by Cold Chisel (usually “Flame Trees” or “Khe Sanh,” let’s not pretend like anything tops them). 
Even worse than that, despite every bone in my body attempting to divert from the teachings my dad so consistently gave me, every time “To Her Door” comes on at a Brisbane pub, I thank my lucky stars it was played until my ears bled because I will never forget a word. 
Knowing the soundtrack of Australia is one of the best party tricks a millennial can have. 
These days, Shannon Noll’s rendition of “What About Me” just isn’t considered to be an extensive archive… oh and don’t even try and drop your pants during “Eagle Rock.”
