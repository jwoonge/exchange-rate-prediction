Alabama college student accused of making terror threat after writing Tyler, the Creator lyrics in library
   A college student at the University of Southern Alabama was accused of making a terroristic threat after writing Tyler, the Creator lyrics on a large flip chart in the school’s library, The Associated Press reported. 
   Jack Aaron Christensen, 21, wrote the refrain from Tyler’s 2011 song “Radicals,” which goes, “Kill people, burn s--t, f--k school.” 
   The incident allegedly took place on or around Sept. 11, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. 
   Another student was arrested on the same charge within a week of Christensen for making a threat on social media. It’s unrelated to Christensen’s case, school officials said. 
   Michael Mitchell, the school’s vice president for student affairs, assured students and faculty in an email that they are working to keep the campus safe. 
   “The students involved in each incident have been barred from university property pending the outcome of student conduct processes,” Mitchell wrote. “No matter the circumstances, our police must treat any possible threat with the utmost seriousness and act immediately to ensure the safety of our campus community.” 
   This isn’t the first time Tyler, the Creator’s lyrics have caused controversy. He was banned from New Zealand in 2014 and the United Kingdom in 2015, but both bans were lifted earlier this year. 
   After being banned from the U.K., Tyler was interviewed by The Guardian where he explained that his violent lyrics were written from the perspective of an alter ego. 
   “(T)hey obviously did some research on these songs that they’re detaining me for,” Tyler said. “So the argument is right there! This song is written from an alter ego — I’m not like this! You could watch any interview and see my personality; see the guy I am. I wouldn’t hurt a fly.”
