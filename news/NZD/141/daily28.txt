New Zealand man brings emotional support clown to layoff meeting
   A New Zealand man gave new meaning to the term “funny business” when he brought a clown to a meeting where he was being told he was losing his job. 
   When copy writer Josh Thompson received an email from his bosses at media agency FCB New Zealand about his role at the company, he knew his days were numbered. 
   “Basically I sensed that this was going to be a redundancy ... so I thought I might as well try to make the best out of this situation,” he told the BBC. 
   New Zealand requires employees be given the option to bring a “support person” to make the situation less stressful, so Thompson hired a clown to accompany him. 
   So, for $200, a clown named Joe sat in on the meeting making balloon animals (a poodle and a unicorn) while Thompson lost his job. 
   "He nodded his head along when I received the bad news as if he was also receiving the bad news," Josh said. 
   “Professionalism at its finest, really.” 
   The clown even mimed crying when the HR reps went over his paperwork. 
   Thompson said he would recommend Joe’s services and, in the meantime, was “making the most of not having a job.”
