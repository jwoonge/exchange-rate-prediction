SEE IT  Is this proof of the Loch Ness Monster?
   New video has surfaced of an eel-shaped animal that has some speculating that the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster has been finally solved. 
   The video, posted by the Ness Fishery Board on Twitter, shows a trout in murky water of the River Ness, which flows north out of the legendary lake. Near the surface, something much larger than the trout swims in and out of frame. 
   “Lets be honest - when you see a large, eel shaped object passing your camera in the River Ness, the first thing you think of is the Loch Ness Monster,” the tweet reads. 
   Earlier this month, a group of researchers from New Zealand published their study of the biodiversity of the lake and concluded that the Loch Ness Monster could be an eel because of the amount of eel DNA they found. 
   “There is probably not a giant scaly reptile swimming around Loch Ness,” Neil Gemmell, lead scientist on the project, said. 
   However, the video might actually show a harmless tree branch. 
   “The footage is of a large ‘eel shaped object’ — it is actually likely to be a tree branch about three meters in length,” Chris Conroy, the director of the Ness Fisheries Board, told ABC News. “Eels are common in the Ness system, but unlikely to reach that size.” 
   The mystery will just have to be solved another day.
