Nazi satire ‘Jojo Rabbit’ wins top prize at Toronto International Film Festival
   “Jojo Rabbit," the new film from New Zealand director Taika Waititi in which a young boy’s imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler, won the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. 
   The World War II-set film, which features a boy who discovers his mother is hiding a Jewish girl from the Nazis in their home, stars newcomer Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, Scarlett Johansson as his mother and Waititi as Hitler. Oscar winner Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson also appear. 
   The People’s Choice, also known as the audience award, is regularly a predictor of Academy Award nominations and even wins. Last year’s Best Picture winner “Green Book” took the top prize in Toronto in 2018. 
   Best Picture winners “Slumdog Millionaire,” “The King’s Speech” and “12 Years A Slave” each snagged the People’s Choice Award as well in previous years. 
   “Jojo Rabbit” will be released Oct. 18.
