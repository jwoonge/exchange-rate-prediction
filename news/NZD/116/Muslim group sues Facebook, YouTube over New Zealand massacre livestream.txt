   The French Council of the Muslim Faith announced Monday that it’s suing Facebook and YouTube for allowing video of the New Zealand shootings to be live-streamed and subsequently reposted on the social platforms. 
   The lawsuit is for “broadcasting a message with violent content abetting terrorism, or of a nature likely to seriously violate human dignity and liable to be seen by a minor,” the Agence France-Presse reported. 
   Such acts can reportedly be punished by 3 years in prison and an $85,000 fine in France. 
   Brenton Tarrant killed 50 people in attacks at two mosques in New Zealand. He live-streamed 17 minutes of the March 15 attack and that video was broadcast on Facebook Live and quickly uploaded to other websites like YouTube. It showed Tarrant as he entered the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch and gunned down worshipers. 
   The council representing millions of Muslims in France claims in the lawsuit that it took Facebook 29 minutes to remove the initial video from the time Tarrant went live. 
   Facebook posted a statement two days after the attack saying 1.5 million videos of the attack were removed globally in the first 24 hours after the shooting, 1.2 million of which were blocked at upload. 
   New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern criticized Facebook and other social platforms for allowing the video to spread so far and rapidly in the days following the attack. 
   “We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,” Ardern said on March 19. “They are the publisher, not just the postman. This cannot be a case of all profit and no responsibility.”
