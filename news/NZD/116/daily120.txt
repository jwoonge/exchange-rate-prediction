New Zealand gunman made formal complaint about the lack of entitlements  officials
   The alleged Australian gunman who massacred 50 and injured 50 in two attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, doesn’t like the way he’s being treated in jail. 
   The alleged murderer made a formal complaint to Department of Corrections that stated he is being deprived of his rights. 
   The alleged white nationalist killer is being held at Auckland Prison in Paremoremo and is under extremely tight security. He is under watch by staff or CCTV for 24 hours a day and has no contact with other prisoners. He isn’t allowed visitors or phone calls and has no access to TV, radio or newspapers. 
   “He is being managed in accordance with the provisions set out in the Corrections Act 2004 and our international obligations for the treatment of prisoners,” a spokesperson told the New Zealand Herald. 
   “For operational security reasons no further information will be provided," the spokesperson said. 
   While the Corrections Act does allow every prisoner to have access to at least one visitor a week, among other provisions, the Act also states entitlements can be stripped or withheld “if there is an emergency in the prison or the security of the prison is threatened or if the health or safety of any person is threatened”. 
   Wardens can withhold entitlements “for purposes of security, good order, or safety; or for the purpose of protective custody.” 
   A source told The Herald that the prisoner was “compliant” and was allowed outside for exercise in a secluded concrete area for one hour a day. 
   The gunman, whose image is being suppressed, is next expected in court next month and will represent himself. He has been charged with one murder so far, but a bevy of other charges, potentially including terrorism-related counts, are expected to be added.
