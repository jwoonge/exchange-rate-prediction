95-year-old World War II vet takes four buses to get to march against racism after New Zealand mosque attacks
   Nothing could stop this 95-year-old World War II vet from attending a march against racism following the New Zealand mosque attacks — not even his four-bus commute. 
   John Sato of Auckland made the journey to show his support for Muslims at a rally against hate Sunday in the city’s Aotea Square, according to Radio New Zealand. 
   While he currently spends most of his days doing household chores or listening to classical music, he was stirred into action after hearing about the horrific shootings at two separate mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on March 15. A 28-year-old Australian man described as a white supremacist has been charged with murder in the attacks that killed 50 people and injured dozens more. 
   “I stayed awake quite a lot at the night,” Sato told RNZ. “I didn’t sleep too well ever since. I thought it was so sad. You can feel the suffering of other people.” 
   “I think it’s such a tragedy," he added of the terrorist attacks. “And yet it has the other side. It has brought people together, no matter what their race or anything. People suddenly realized we’re all one. We care for each other.” 
   Sato, who says his mom was Scottish and his dad was Japanese, got some help along the march route, with a police officer and another man helping him walk. 
   “Policeman took me all the way home, waited down there until he saw me getting up the stairs,” Sato said. “The tragedy in Christchurch, look at what it brought out in people. It shows the best of humanity.” 
   Sato was recruited into the New Zealand army during WWII to fight against Japan. He told RNZ that he was one of only two Japanese servicemen in the New Zealand army in that war. 
   Both Sato’s wife and their only daughter, who was born blind, died 15 years ago.
