   Investigators in California are searching for an arsonist who set fire to a mosque and left disturbing graffiti referencing the deadly New Zealand terror attacks. 
   Seven people were inside the Islamic Center of Escondido early Sunday when the fire started, but no injuries were reported. Mosque members were able to extinguish the blaze before firefighters arrived around 3:15 a.m. 
   “There are people who sleep there overnight,” member Yusef Miller told NBC in San Diego. “They heard the sounds, they smelled some funny smells, and there was a letter saying something connecting to New Zealand at the same time. So, this made everybody especially on edge.” 
   A message in graffiti was found in the parking lot of the mosque. It made mention of the attack on two mosques in New Zealand that left 50 people dead, but Escondido police did not reveal specific details. 
   “It is disturbing enough that some sick individual would attempt to burn a house of worship to the ground, but referencing the slayings in New Zealand is beyond the pale,” Dustin Craun of the Council of American-Islamic Relations in San Diego said in a statement. “While the majority of humanity has responded to the tragedy to draw closer to one another and refute hatred, a violent and hate-filled minority seeks further divisions.” 
   The incident was being investigated as a possible hate crime. Anyone with information should contact the Escondido Police Department at (760) 743-8477. 
   “Everybody should stay absolutely vigilant and watchful over their prayer centers," Lt. Chris Lick told NBC. "If there are people in the neighbor that are not supposed to be there, please give us a call. We have also just re-doubled our efforts in terms of making sure that there’s a high police presence in the area.” 
   The mosque was created four years ago and serves several hundred people in the city. 
   “We won’t stop praying,” Miller told NBC. “We won’t stop gathering.”
