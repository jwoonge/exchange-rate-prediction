Minor earthquake reported off Atlantic City coast
   An earthquake struck about 40 miles from Atlantic City over the weekend, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 
   The minor shake-up happened under the Atlantic Ocean, 4 miles below the Earth’s surface. There were no reports of anyone on the Jersey Shore having noticed tremors from the modest seismic shift that appeared to occur shortly before 10 a.m. Saturday. 
   Earthquakes in New Jersey are very rare and, according to the state’s government website, nobody has ever been killed by one in the Garden State. 
   “Damage in New Jersey from earthquakes has been minor: items knocked off shelves, cracked plaster and masonry, and fallen chimneys,” the site states. 
   Bruce Springsteen, arguably New Jersey’s most famous export, has a connection to hurricane recovery. His 2000 song “My City of Ruins” was in constant rotation following the deadly 2011 quake in Christchurch, New Zealand, when media outlets there frequently played snippets from the tune that’s chorus urges citizens of a disaster-afflicted town to “Come on, rise up!” 
   The Boss famously dedicated the song to Kiwi rescue workers during a subsequent world tour.
