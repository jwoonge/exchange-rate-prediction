Women’s World Cup  Odds and Props as U.S. takes aim at fourth title
   The U.S. women are aiming for a fourth World Cup title when the 2019 edition kicks off on Friday in France (the USWNT’s first game is Tuesday, June 11 against Thailand in Reims). The defending champs are FIFA’s top-ranked team and the odds makers have installed Jill Ellis’ squad as the favorite to hoist the trophy in Lyon on July 7. 
   Since most experts consider this tournament to be the most wide open in history, we turned to our friends at SportsBetting.ag for insight into this year’s field. Behind the powerhouse American squad are a trio of European powers - the hosts (7/2), two-time champion Germany (11/2) and the Lionesses from England (7/1). 
   World Cup fans can bet on much more than just who wins and loses. Prop bets for this month’s tournament include: will a player take off her jersey like Brandi Chastain did in 1999 to celebrate the U.S. victory over China, will President Trump show up in France and how many red cards will be handed out along the way.
