Jack Sock wins match for 1st time this year at Delray Beach
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) â€” Top-seeded Jack Sock won a match for the first time this year Monday, beating qualifier John-Patrick Smith 6-4, 6-4 on the opening night of the Delray Beach Open. 
   Sock, the highest-ranked American at No. 8, is attempting to become the first player to win consecutive titles at Delray since the tournament moved from Coral Springs, Florida, in 1999. 
   The match was the first for Sock since he lost to Yuichi Sugita last month in the first round of the Australian Open. He also dropped a first-round match in Auckland, New Zealand. 
   Sock made it a first-day sweep for Americans. Donald Young beat qualifier Ramkumar Ramanathan 6-1, 6-2. Wild card Francis Tiafoe beat Matthew Ebden 6-2, 2-6, 6-2.
