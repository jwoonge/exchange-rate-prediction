Kesha cancels upcoming shows, announces she will undergo surgery
   Kesha is canceling her upcoming tour dates â€” but it's not without good reason. 
   The "Tik Tok" singer fell during a performance in Dubai on Feb. 9 that left her with a torn ACL and doctors informed her she will have to undergo surgery to repair it, she wrote on Twitter. 
   "I'm heartbroken to be forced to postpone some of my upcoming international dates due to a recent injury I sustained while performing," she wrote. 
   "It's my biggest joy in life to share my music with my fans all over the world, but I have to follow my doctor's orders and undergo surgery today to repair my torn ACL so I can get ready to give it my all on my Summer tour and beyond," the pop star continued. 
   Kesha, 30, specified that her surgery was taking place on Tuesday and it will be quickly followed by rehab to get her ready for the next tour. 
   The singer was set to perform in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Japan in March and April and will be postponing 11 dates. 
   Ticket-holders will be informed about rescheduled dates. The Byron Bay Bluesfest will be unable to be rescheduled, according to her reps. 
   She is scheduled to join Macklemore on a 30-show tour in North America this summer, called "The Adventures of Kesha and Macklemore."
