Fritz Schmid named New Zealand soccer coach
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) â€” Switzerland-born Fritz Schmid has been appointed head coach of the New Zealand men's soccer team on a four-year contract. 
   Schmid, whose previous role was as technical director of the Malaysian Football Association, is a former assistant coach of the Austria national team. He was also an assistant at FC Basel between 2002 and 2009 when it won the Swiss Cup four times and twice qualified for the UEFA Champions League. 
   New Zealand Football technical director Andreas Heraf said Friday that Schmid "has a proven track record at the highest level of coaching in Europe." 
   Schmid will first lead New Zealand in a friendly against Canada in Spain next month. 
   He replaces England-born Anthony Hudson, who quit late last year after coaching New Zealand since 2014.
