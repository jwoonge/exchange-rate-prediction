Brian Cashman says Clint Frazier will be odd man out when Aaron Hicks returnsÂ 
   In a wide-ranging interview with WFAN's Mike Francesa, Brian Cashman announced that Clint Frazier will likely be sent back down to the minors when Aaron Hicks returns from the disabled list. 
   "When Hicks comes back, assuming everyone stays healthy, (Frazier) will probably be optioned out," Cashman said, noting Aaron Judge and Brett Gardner would be holding down the two other outfield spots. "There's no other way to way to fit it all in." 
   According to Cashman, Hicks is just two-to-three weeks away from getting back into the lineup. 
   Since being called up to the Big Leagues, Frazier has shown the promise the Yankees were expecting when they shipped reliever Andrew Miller to the Indians for the prized prospect. 
   In thirteen game this season, Frazier has hit .298 with three home runs and an impressive .944 OPS. 
   Cashman did note that September call ups will be right around the corner after Hicks' returns, allowing Frazier to return to the Bronx. 
   Cashman also praised his current bullpen after the additions of David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle from the White Sox to go along with Aroldis Chapman and Dellin Betances, saying they could give the Yankees four innings a night and that guys will be used in different spots depending on use. 
   "They have all been sat down and talked to," Cashman said. "And I think they're all on notice to expect the unexpected because they're all capable of pitching high-leverage situations. 
   "They're all ready to do whatever's necessary to help us win."
