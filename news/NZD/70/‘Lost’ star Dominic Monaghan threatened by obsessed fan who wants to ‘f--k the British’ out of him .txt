   Dominic Monaghan needs his stalker to get lost. 
   The "Lost" star is being harassed by an obsessed fan named Meredith McLarty, according to TMZ, who has written in emails that she wants to "f--k the British out" of the actor. 
   "I could show up in New Zealand tomorrow and you [sic] I could rip off your clothes and f--k the British out of you and you couldn't use the restraining order against me because it's in L.A. County, not New Zealand," one of McLarty's more than 54 unsolicited emails obtained by TMZ reads. 
   She has reportedly continued to violate the protective order obtained by the 41-year-old actor by sending the message between Oct. 9 2017 and Nov. 7 2017, according to TMZ. 
   Monaghan said in court documents obtained by TMZ that he had to delete his public email address and change the way he interacts with his fans due to the level of harassment. He also revealed that he is concerned for his safety after the woman sent a physical piece of mail to his Los Angeles home. 
   Authorities have obtained a search warrant to access McLarty's email and social media accounts, according to TMZ. 
   Her correspondence contains disturbing poems, partially nude photos, porn site links and "various sexually explicit messages," according to the gossip site. 
   McLarty was arrested at LAX in September 2016 after she threatened to kill Monaghan after he obtained the restraining orders. 
   Her threats stretch back to 2004.
