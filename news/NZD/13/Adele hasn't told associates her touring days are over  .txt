   Hello again someday? 
   Adele fans went rolling into a deep tizzy last month when the "One and Only" singer dropped hints during a New Zealand performance that her current tour may be her last one. 
   But insiders tied to the British superstar tell us that came as news to them, and they doubt we will have seen the last of the 28-year-old singer after this tour ends with four sold-out performances in London's Wembley Stadium in June. 
   During an aside in Auckland, New Zealand, on March 26, the singer talked about life on the road and how it hasn't gotten any easier. 
   "I don't know if I will ever tour again," she told the Kiwi audience. 
   However, a business associate of the star's said: "Adele has not told anyone in her team that she has quit touring or doesn't want to play anymore gigs." 
   Well-placed sources believe that Adele was "tired" following 18 months of promotion and live gigs and called her on-stage statement "an expulsion of emotions." 
   We're also told Adele is "being offered insane amounts of cash to play anything from one-off festivals to residencies." 
   Our insider wouldn't be surprised if Adele, who took three years off after having a son in 2012, has a second child. But that source expects her to release another album by late 2020, which could mean more performances. 
   "She knows that once she rocks Wembley, live tours trekking around the world are something she doesn't need to even think about for five years," we're told. 
   Her management team declined to comment on this story. 
   Whatever her plans, the singer has certainly found a cozy place to nest. 
   British tabloids reported on Sunday that Adele had purchased a $5 million, 18th-century manor in a sleepy part of Sussex, England, that includes a fireplace and a tree house.
