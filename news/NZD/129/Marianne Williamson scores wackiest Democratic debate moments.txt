   The fact that Marianne Williamson is usually referred to as “self-help author” should’ve given America a clue about what we were in for. 
   Williamson took the Democratic debate right off the deep end Thursday night, musing about calling New Zealand, beating Donald Trump with love, chronic illnesses and even going back to the moon. 
   It was a breakout moment for all the wrong reasons for the little-known fringe candidate, who was polling even below Mayor Bill de Blasio coming into the debate. 
   Williamson, who was also assigned the “de Blasio” spot on the far left end of the 10 candidates didn’t even get to talk for the first 27 minutes of the debate. 
   When she did open her mouth, nothing good happened. 
   She started by musing about beating President Trump with better policies, then pivoted to suggesting he won because “Make America Great Again” is a good slogan. 
   While others were sparring over details of their health plans, Williamson mused about the chemicals in our environment are causing “chronic diseases.” 
   And it went on. She took being spaced out to a new level by talking about returning to the moon. 
   Then Williamson said her first call as president would be to the leader of New Zealand to chide her for claiming that it’s the best country to grow up as a girl. 
   Fellow candidates peered quizzically at Williamson as she ended by suggesting the way to beat Trump is with a four-letter word. 
   “So Mr. President, if you’re listening, I want you to hear me please: You have harnessed fear for political purposes, and only love can cast that out," she said. “I will meet you on that field, and sir, love will win.” 
   Good luck with that, Marianne.
