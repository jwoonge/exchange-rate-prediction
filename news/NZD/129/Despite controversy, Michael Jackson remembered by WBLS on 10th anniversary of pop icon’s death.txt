   Even in the aftermath of the recent “Leaving Neverland” documentary, New York City radio station WBLS-FM continues to show love and support to Michael Jackson. 
   On Tuesday, the Emmis-owned R&B station plans to dedicate most of its programming to the late King of Pop on June 25, the 10th anniversary of the music icon’s death. 
   Program director Skip Dillard said a special focus will be made to Jackson’s music, along with requests and memories from listeners by phone and through social media. 
   “Michael’s music really touches the highs and lows of so many lives of those who grew up in the 1980s and 90s,” he said. “From grade school to college to dating to marriage to break ups to sweet 16 parties, so many of us remember [him] being played during all these moments in our lives.” 
   In March, radio stations in Canada, New Zealand and Australia removed the “Thriller” singer’s songs from their playlists after two men who had initially denied they were sexually abused were featured in the controversial HBO documentary with new allegations. 
   WBLS has never wavered in its playing of Jackson’s music on any of its shows, which include the nationally-syndicated “Steve Harvey Morning Show,” and shows hosted by Shaila Scott, Fred “Bugsy” Buggs, Déjà vu, Lenny Green and Dr. Bob Lee. 
   The quality of the music is undeniable, Dillard said. 
   “The perfection that went into an MJ song is hard to find in today’s world of quickly getting songs or albums up on various digital music services for more streams.” 
   The station has also been promoting a “Michael Jackson” dance party that is free and open to the public at the Taj Lounge on June 25 from 5 p.m. to midnight. 
   WBLS deejays Bent Roc, Dj Enuff, Mitch the people Plezzer and Mike C will spin the hit songs from throughout this career dating back to the Jackson 5 and including music from The Jacksons era and his solo works.
