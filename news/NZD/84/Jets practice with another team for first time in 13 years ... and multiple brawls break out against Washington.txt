   The Jets took part in a joint practice for the first time in 13 years Sunday, and, well, it was memorable — and ugly. 
   Ahead of Gang Green's preseason game at Washington, the teams decided to hold three practices together, the first resulting in multiple brawls, one which spilled into a "watch" area. 
   Even some fans, who captured the dustups on video, reportedly scuffled at Bon Secours Training Center in Richmond, Va. Two fans had to be separated by police, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. 
   The biggest fights seemed to occur when Washington's offense and the Jets' defense were on the field. Jets cornerback Trumaine Johnson — who reportedly hit Washington offensive lineman Morgan Moses after a play — told the Times-Dispatch that "it was a friendly competition." 
   Prior to the practice, Jets coach Todd Bowles wasn't concerned about anything going down, despite Washington linebacker Zach Brown saying in June that his team would "have it out for" former teammate and wide receiver Terrelle Pryor. 
   "Coach (Jay) Gruden coaches his team well," Bowles said. "It's just talk and banter. We're going down there for them to make us better, hopefully we make them better and we can get better as a team. Anything else to me is nonsense." 
   Welp. 
   The teams still have joint practices Monday and Tuesday — though members of the Jets and Washington front offices reportedly met after Sunday's debacle — and face off at 8 p.m. Thursday at FedEx Field.
