Ex-Jets QB Christian Hackenberg signs with Eagles
   Quarterback Christian Hackenberg has found another new home. 
   The 2016 Jets second-round pick, who has never played an NFL game, was signed by the Eagles, the team announced Sunday. He was cut by the Raiders in June, three weeks after Gang Green dealt him to Oakland for a conditional seventh-round pick, negating the trade. 
   Hackenberg, who was fourth on Oakland's depth chart, joins a Philly team that already has four quarterbacks on its roster: Carson Wentz, Nick Foles, Nate Sudfeld and Joe Callahan. But the move reportedly has nothing to do with the health of Wentz or Foles and rather is just an opportunity to develop another signal-caller; Wentz is recovering from a torn ACL and LCL, while Super Bowl MVP Foles suffered neck spasms last week. 
   Before Hackenberg was picked up by the Eagles, the 23-year-old was drawing interest from the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos and visited with the Patriots. 
   The Penn State product was a bust for the Jets, unable to beat out Bryce Petty or Geno Smith with poor preseason performances during his two years in New York. Jets GM Mike Maccagnan gave up on Hackenberg after he drafted Sam Darnold with the No. 3 overall pick in April.
