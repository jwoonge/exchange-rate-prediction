Lorde takes out full-page ad in New Zealand Herald celebrating women after Grammys snub 
   Lorde isn't being melodramatic, she's just thankful. 
   The singer, who was the only woman nominated the best album of the year Grammy for "Melodrama" but wasn't asked to perform at the ceremony, took to the presses to praise her fans — and praise women. 
   "I just wanted to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for loving & embracing Melodrama the way you did," she wrote on the hand-written letter that was included in the paper. 
   "Thank you also for believing in female musicians. You set a beautiful precedent." 
   The New Zealand native fired up the conversation about female representation after she was the only best album nominee, and only female, not to be asked to perform solo at the ceremony. 
   At the awards, she had a poem by feminist artist Jenny Holzer sewed into the back of her red grown and called it her white rose moment. 
   Grammy producer Ken Ehrlich basically said there just wasn't enough room for a Lorde performance. 
   "We have a box and it gets full. She had a great album. There's no way we can really deal with everybody," he said in a statement. 
   Recording Academy President Neil Portnow faced sharp criticism after saying women need to "step up" in the industry. 
   "I think it has to begin with women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, who want to be producers, who want to be part of the industry on the executive level to step up," he said. 
   Portnow later backtracked on his comments saying they didn't accurately get across his message. 
   About 9% of all Grammy nominees between 2013 and 2018 were women, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg's journalism school.
