   Cambodia puts Baby in the corner. 
   A party featuring up to 100 attendees got raided by Cambodian police, resulting in 10 foreigners getting locked up for "dancing pornographically" and allegedly posting images online. 
   Titled "Let's Get Wet," the event featured mostly Westerners and expatriates. 
   Of those who remain in custody, five are British, two are Canadian, one is Norwegian, one is Dutch and one is a New Zealander. 
   "We're innocent," said the detained British nationals in a group statement. "We don't know why we've been arrested â€“ we're getting different stories from different people. 
   "It was really confusing. Everyone was confused. They raided, rounded us up - there was about 80 to 100 people at this party, some of them were tourists. There were about 30 of them (police officers.)" 
   Following their arrests, Cambodian police posted images of mostly clothed people on what looks to be a dance floor with each other, but they failed to provide any details about when the photos were taken and who the individuals were. 
   According to the Telegraph, some say the police photos are from a different event entirely and that the people in them aren't those who have been imprisoned. 
   Under the country's 2007 Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation, it's illegal to produce pornography, while the Phnom Penh Post reports that the foreigners could go to prison for a year and get fined up to $500. 
   Worse still, they could potentially spend six months behind bars before their cases are even heard.
