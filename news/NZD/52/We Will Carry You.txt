It was morning on Perth’s Scarborough Beach. From the promenade, I stood watching the Indian Ocean’s frothy white tops. The light was crisp and clear, and razor-sharp shadows fell across the ground. 
From the corner of my eye, I saw two young men appear on the promenade, one on foot, the other in an electric wheelchair. I watched them have an animated discussion, point at the water, and then each other. 
Eventually, the man on foot walked away, strode purposely across the sand and disappeared up the beach. 
I thought they had an argument. I was about to go ask the man in the wheelchair if he needed help. He looked abandoned.
But then I saw them approaching: two bronzed lifeguards. 
The man on foot was behind them, pointing at his friend. The lifeguards had biceps like Christmas hams. Together, they lifted the man from his chair and removed his clothes, leaving only his shorts in place. Muscles tensing, the guards carried the man down to the surf using a two-handed seat carry. 
Cradling his limp body in their arms, they let him half float in the water between them. His friend watched, smiling.
Sitting where the surf flirted with the sand, all I could hear was the sound of laughter above the music of the waves.
