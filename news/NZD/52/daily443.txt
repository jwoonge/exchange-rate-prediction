Lorde scribbled thanks to fans for embracing nominated album
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) â€” Lorde has scribbled her thanks to fans back home for embracing her Grammy-nominated album. 
   Her handwritten thank-you note was published as an ad in The New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The note has doodles honoring fellow Kiwi musicians as well as sightings of other attendees at the Grammy ceremony in New York on Sunday night. 
   She also thanks them for believing in female musicians, "You set a beautiful precedent!" 
   Social media took her absence among the night's performances as a snub, since other album of the year nominees performed as did classic rockers with no current nominations. 
   Recording Academy President Neil Portnow had said backstage that it was hard to have a balanced show, but later had to walk back a comment that women had to "step up."
