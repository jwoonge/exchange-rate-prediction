   Three celestial events will overlap with one another at the end of the month to light up the night sky in a way that hasn't been seen in over 150 years. 
   A total lunar eclipse, full moon and "super blue moon" will combine on Jan. 31 for this rare event, according to Space.com. What makes the super moon also a blue moon is the perfect, dual timing of the second full moon of the month (a blue moon) — a rare occurrence in itself — and the moment when the moon is closest to Earth in its orbit, making it appear bigger and brighter than usual. 
   The major moon experience will be visible in the early morning hours over most of the Pacific Ocean, Central and East Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand and most of Australia. It won't be visible from anywhere on the continental U.S. but Alaska and Hawaii will see a partial view. In New York, the eclipse will take place as the moon is setting, making it invisible. 
   For people in areas where it will be visible, the moon will look red as a result of all of the world's sun events reflecting off its surface; the appearance that netted it the nickname, blood moon. 
   "We're seeing all of the Earth's sunrises and sunsets at that moment reflected from the surface of the Moon," Program Scientist at NASA headquarters, Sarah Noble, said in a release. 
   The total phase of the eclipse — for those who can see it — will be 77 minutes.
