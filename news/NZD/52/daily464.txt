   Neil Diamond will stay off the road. 
   The legendary singer announced Monday he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and that, following doctors' orders, he will retire from touring. 
   "It is with great reluctance and disappointment that I announce my retirement from concert touring. I have been so honored to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years. My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows," Diamond said in a statement on his website. 
   "I plan to remain active in writing, recording and other projects for a long time to come. My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world. You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement. This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you." 
   The Brooklyn native will wrap up his 50th anniversary tour in October in London, but the third leg of the tour, scheduled for Australia and New Zealand, has been canceled. 
   Paul Dainty, president/CEO of tour promoter TEG Dainty, said he was "devastated and saddened" by the news. 
   "I have had the honour of promoting Neil's numerous tours in Australia and New Zealand, he is one of the world's greatest artists and we and his thousands and thousands of fans here will miss seeing him tour down under," Dainty said in a statement, 
   Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, will be presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Recording Academy at the Grammy Awards Sunday. 
   "So,so sorry to hear about the great Neil Diamond's illness. I'm rooting for you Neil! Fight on from another Brooklyn boy," Barry Manilow tweeted.
