   What would the Grammys be without some good old-fashioned melodrama? 
   Lorde will not perform at Sunday night's award show after not being offered a solo slot, according to Variety. 
   Despite being nominated for Album of the Year — the evening's top prize — the 21-year-old New Zealander was asked to perform "American Girl," as part of a ensemble honoring the late Tom Petty. 
   All four of her male counterparts in that category — JAY-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars and Childish Gambino — were reportedly invited to perform their own music. 
   Lorde's mother Sonja Yelich tweeted a photo of a section of a New York Times article last week outlining the Grammys' recent lack of female nominees. 
   "Of the 899 people to be nominated for Grammy awards in the past six years, only nine per cent were women," the section reads. 
   Lorde was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2014 and won two — Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance — for "Royals," which she performed on the show that year. 
   Lorde's snub comes amid speculation about how the Grammys will handle its own "#MeToo" moment. 
   Kelly Clarkson, Halsey, Cyndi Lauper and Rita Ora are among the stars expected to continue the protest against sexual misconduct Sunday night by attaching white roses to their outfits out of support for the Time's Up initiative. 
   Recording Academy president Neil Portnow spoke about the snub after the show Sunday night. 
   "We have a wealth of wishes every year, and it's hard to have a balanced show and have everybody involved," he said. 
   "Every year is different. We can't have a performance from every nominee. We have over 80 categories, and so we have to realize that we've got to create something that has balance, and so on and so forth. What you saw was our best judgement on how to do that."
