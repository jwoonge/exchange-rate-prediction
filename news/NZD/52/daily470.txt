Timbers acquire winger Andy Polo from Liga MX club
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” The Portland Timbers have acquired winger Andy Polo on loan from Liga MX club Monarcas Morelia for the upcoming season. 
   The 23-year-old native of Peru played in 25 matches last year for Morelia and made six starts with two goals. 
   He's also World Cup-bound, having appeared in Peru's two-legged playoff against New Zealand in November. Peru won 2-0 on aggregate. Overall, he's appeared with the Peruvian national team 15 times since his senior debut in 2016. 
   "Andy is a versatile, young player who will add another element to our attack, and we believe that he has further upside to his development," Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said in a statement. 
   The Timbers used targeted allocation money and have a purchase option. Polo's arrival is pending a physical and receipt of a visa. 
   He will occupy an international roster spot.
