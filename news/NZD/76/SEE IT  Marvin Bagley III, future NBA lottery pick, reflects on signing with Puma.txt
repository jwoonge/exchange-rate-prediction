   Marvin Bagley III has one message for fans following his decision to sign with Puma. 
   “Stay tuned,” the future NBA lottery pick told freelance videographer Adam Glyn on Tuesday in New York. 
   Bagley III, along with fellow top prospect Deandre Ayton, made a splash earlier this week by signing with Puma, which hasn’t featured an NBA player since Vince Carter in 1998. 
   The former Duke forward put up 21 points and just over 11 rebounds during his lone season with the Blue Devils.
