   The staff at an Asics sports retail store in Auckland, New Zealand were hard put to explain why the huge TV display screens in the shop’s window started broadcasting porn at 1 a.m. over the weekend. 
   The store manager apologized and said police were investigating what might be a hack. 
   “Head office and our IT team have begun a full investigation into what happened and who uploaded the page,” the manager, identifying himself only as John, told the New Zealand Herald. “Screens were immediately turned off to the units immediately when they turned up for work on Sunday. Clearly this is an embarrassing situation, and Asics has apologized through our website and also by email to our customer database.” 
   Staff called police after arriving to open up around 10 a.m. to discover the filthy footage. Authorities confirmed a probe was under way. 
   Meanwhile passersby, some with children in tow, were shocked to see the sex scenes right there on the street. 
   “I took a second look because I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” Tanya Lee, who stumbled across the display as she took her 7-year-old son to breakfast, told the Herald. “Not something you want kids exposed to, and it’s also embarrassing for Auckland as a tourist destination.” 
   “Some people were shocked, but others just stopped and watched,” said Dwayne Hinagano, a security officer who told the Herald he saw it playing for at least two hours. 
   One witness, who was not identified, said the footage had been running since at least 1 a.m. 
   The Japanese company’s New Zealand office issued a terse statement. 
   “This morning an unknown person gained access to the screens above our Central Auckland store and some objectionable content was displayed on the screens,” Asics New Zealnd said in a Facebook post. “We would like to apologize to anyone who may have seen this. We are working with our software and online security suppliers to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”
