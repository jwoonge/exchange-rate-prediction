Family outraged after Universal Studios character made ‘OK’ symbol over girl’s shoulder in vacation photo
   A Colorado family was outraged after discovering a potential hate symbol in a photo of their children posing with characters during a trip to Universal Orlando Resorts. 
   Tiffiney Zinger, who is black, and her husband Richard Zinger, traveled with their children to Orlando in March. During a day trip to Universal Orlando, the family stopped at a character breakfast at one of the resort’s hotels. 
   It was there that Zinger’s daughter, who is biracial and has autism, posed for a photo with an actor dressed as Gru from the “Despicable Me” series. Her little brother posed with a Minion. 
   In the photo, the actor dressed as Gru makes an upside-down OK symbol with his hand over the girl’s shoulder. 
   The gesture has become a symbol used by white nationalists in recent years. The Zingers’ photo was taken a week after the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter flashed the gesture in court. 
   “We just wanted to take them to see the minions,” Tiffiney Zinger told USA Today. “Do something special for our family and this person ruined that special warm feeling.” 
   The Zingers didn’t even notice what had happened until they were reviewing the photos and videos taken on the trip in order to help their daughter with a second grade class project. 
   “I’ve been emotionally distraught about it. I’m still pretty upset that someone felt they needed to do this to children,” Tiffiney said. “It can cause emotional stress on my child and her development.” 
   The family said it reached out to Universal after discovering the gesture and they were offered a gift card and free tickets. 
   USA Today reported that the resort has fired the actor in the photo.
