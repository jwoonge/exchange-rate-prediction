Facebook’s Zuckerberg promises new apps, ‘private future’
   CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced a redesign for Facebook apps Tuesday at the company’s annual F8 conference — and alluded to new efforts to protect user data in the wake of widespread criticism. 
   “I believe that the future is private,” Zuckerberg said on stage during his keynote address. 
   “I get that a lot of people aren’t sure that we’re serious about this. I get that we don’t have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly,” he added. “But I’m committed to doing this well, and to starting a new chapter for our products.” 
   On product changes, Zuckerberg said the redesign for the Facebook app would be immediate, and redesigns for Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram would offer better protection to users and make those services faster. 
   The embattled CEO said eventually Messenger would have entirely encrypted messages, but did not give a timeline of when that change would be implemented. 
   Zuckerberg did not address how the company collects user data and sidestepped how it was working to combat hate speech on its myriad products, according to NBC News. 
   Facebook came under intense scrutiny in March when video of the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter’s rampage remained on their servers for hours.
