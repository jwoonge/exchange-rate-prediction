A Broken Skull, a Dubious Paper Trail  Australian Justice for One Aboriginal Man
DARWIN, Australia — Patrick Cumaiyi boarded a small plane on the airstrip in Wadeye, one of Australia’s most remote Aboriginal communities, and waved to his family with shackled hands.
He was being flown to Darwin, the capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, to face a domestic-violence complaint. But before takeoff, an argument broke out. An officer delivered a sharp blow to Mr. Cumaiyi’s head with a metal flashlight, according to witnesses on board, then another officer dragged Mr. Cumaiyi headfirst onto the tarmac.
In a video from the scene, about 20 people can be heard shouting in distress. “Warrundut pelpith!” — “He landed on his head!” — screams a woman in Murrinh-Patha, the native language of the 2,200 people who live in Wadeye, a tropical outpost in Australia’s far north.
