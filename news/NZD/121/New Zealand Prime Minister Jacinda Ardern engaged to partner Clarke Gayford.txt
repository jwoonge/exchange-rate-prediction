   New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is engaged to her partner, television host Clarke Gayford. 
   The couple’s engagement was confirmed by Arderns’ press secretary, Andrew Campbell. 
   A journalism intern spotted the ring on 38-year-old Ardern’s middle finger on her left hand at a ceremony on Friday. The Prime Minister’s spokesperson then confirmed the engagement, which happened over Easter. 
   During an interview with BBC in January, Ardern was asked if she would ever propose to 41-year-old Gayford. 
   “No I would not ask, no. I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonize about that question himself,” she told BBC, but said she is a feminist. 
   Previous speculations went around in 2017 that Ardern was engaged — but she crushed the rumors on Facebook Live, saying she wore a ring on the ring finger of her left hand because she suffered from eczema, New Zeland Herald reported. 
   “I’m happy to confirm that I have eczema on my left hand, which causes me to rotate where I wear my beautiful onyx ring. So no I am not engaged,” she said at the time." 
   Ardern and Gayford met at an awards event in 2012. The two have a daughter together, a 10-month-old named Neve Te Aroha. Ardern, who has held office since 2017, made history as the second elected world leader to give birth while in office in June 2018. 
   The Prime Minister was praised after she vowed to never speak the name of the shooter responsible for the terrorist attack at two Christchurch mosques in March. Just days after the tragedy, Ardern banned all assault weapons in New Zealand.
