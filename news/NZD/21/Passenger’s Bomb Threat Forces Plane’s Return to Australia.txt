A Malaysia Airlines plane returned to Australia on Wednesday after a disruptive passenger, who claimed to have a bomb, attempted to enter the cockpit, the authorities said.
“It is believed that the suspect is a Sri Lankan national, and that he was drunk,” said Datuk Seri Ab Aziz Kaprawi, Malaysia’s deputy transport minister according to The Star, a Malaysian newspaper.
Flight MH128 — heading to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Melbourne — was in the air for just 14 minutes, according to Flightradar24, an aircraft monitoring site, before turning around. Once on the ground, the plane was met by armed police officers who escorted the man off.
“Malaysia Airlines would like to stress that at no point was the aircraft ‘hijacked,’” the airline said in a statement.
The man “claimed to have a bomb,” Mr. Kaprawi said. “It was not a bomb but a power bank,” referring to a portable charger for electronic devices.
According to the police in the Australian state of Victoria, the man never gained access to the cockpit.
“The man was subdued and a safety plan was enacted,” Senior Constable Adam West, a police spokesman, said in a statement.
Australian news media reported that 11 passengers tackled the man in order to restrain him.
“The plane landed safely at the airport, and passengers are currently exiting the plane and speaking to investigators,” Mr. West said. “There appears to be no imminent threat to passengers, staff or public, and the investigation is ongoing.”
Passengers were removed from the plane and given accommodations at Melbourne hotels, the airline said.
Flights to and from Melbourne Airport were briefly diverted, but the airport returned to regular service.
Malaysia Airlines, the country’s national carrier, made headlines twice in 2014, when Flight 370 — yet to be found — disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and when Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.
