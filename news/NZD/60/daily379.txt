England-NZ rugby league tests in US for next 3 years
   DENVER (AP) â€” England and New Zealand will play each other in the first of three rugby league tests in the United States over the next three years. 
   The match on June 23 will be at Sports Authority Field, home of the NFL's Denver Broncos. 
   It is hoped the series will raise the profile of the game in North America, which is staging the 2025 Rugby League World Cup.
