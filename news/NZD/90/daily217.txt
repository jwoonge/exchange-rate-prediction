Rob Gronkowski threatened to retire if traded to Lions  report
   Rob Gronkowski spiked a trade to the Lions. 
   The Patriots and Detroit were deep into trade talks this past offseason regarding the star tight end, according to ESPN, and a blockbuster deal nearly went down around the draft. 
   But Gronk threatened to retire rather than go to the Motor City — or anywhere else for that matter. 
   So it might have been a little awkward Sunday night when Gronkowski went up against what could have been his teammates. 
   The report isn’t completely out of the blue. 
   Earlier this month, NFL.com reported Gronkowski had “strongly resisted” a potential trade this summer. He only wanted to catch passes from Tom Brady, the report indicated. 
   The Pats ultimately reworked Gronk’s deal to keep him alongside his quarterback.
