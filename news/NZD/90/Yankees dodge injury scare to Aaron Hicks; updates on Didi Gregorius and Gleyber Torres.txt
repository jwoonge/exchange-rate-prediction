   The Yankees can breathe a huge sigh of relief. 
   After all, they dodged what would have been another massive injury blow. 
   An MRI administered to Aaron Hicks revealed no tear in the outfielder's left hamstring, manager Aaron Boone told reporters before Tuesday's game against the Rays. 
   Hicks left Monday's game in the fourth inning due to tightness and is now considered day-to-day. 
   "We feel like we dodged a bullet," Boone said. 
   That they did, because losing a bat responsible for 26 home runs and 76 RBI could have spelled doom for the Yanks heading into the wild card. 
   The Yankees needed some positive injury news after Boone dropped a bombshell on Sunday, indicating Didi Gregorius had torn cartilage in his right wrist. 
   The shortstop did field some some ground balls without throwing before batting practice Tuesday, according to reports. 
   Gleyber Torres was also absent from Tuesday’s lineup due to tightness in his hip/groin area. 
   But not to worry, at least for now, as Boone said he isn’t concerned and planned on giving the rookie a day off during the series regardless.
