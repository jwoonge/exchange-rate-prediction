   Tyrius Walker has turned a solid showing at Summer League into a deal with the Knicks. 
   The team on Tuesday announced the signing of Walker after the guard averaged 6.3 points, two assists and 1.7 rebounds over 11 minutes in three Summer games. 
   Walker put up 16 points, six assists, five rebounds, five steals and one block in 26 minutes during the Knicksâ€™ 102-83 win over the Pelicans back in July. 
   Walker spent four years at Morehouse College, a Division II program.
