   Someone should throw the new Flyers mascot in the penalty box. 
   For life. 
   Philadelphia on Monday unveiled “Gritty,” a googly-eyed mascot straight out of a horror movie. 
   “His father was a "bully," so naturally he has some of those tendencies - talented but feisty, a fierce competitor, known for his agility given his size,” its bio on the team’s site reads. “He's loyal but mischievous; the ultimate Flyers fan who loves the orange and black, but is unwelcoming to anyone who opposes his team. Legend has it he earned the name "Gritty" for possessing an attitude so similar to the team he follows.” 
   Creepy mascots in sports are nothing new. 
   But Gritty now might be at the top of the list. 
   It also bears somewhat of a resemblance to the “Phillie Phanatic,” of course the mascot for the city’s baseball team.
