SEE IT  Seal slaps kayaker in the face with an octopus
   Mother Nature fights back. 
   A kayaker in New Zealand got a face full of the ocean during a recent excursion off the coast of Kaikoura, when a seal jumped out of the ocean and hit him in the face — with an octopus. 
   “He thrashed it in mid fight and my face happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Kyle Mulinder told Yahoo 7. 
   “I was like ‘mate, what just happened?’” 
   The entire encounter, thankfully, was caught on GoPro, which shows Mulinder briefly terrified, then seemingly exhilarated. 
   The octopus stuck to the kayak after the seal released it, Mulinder said, but he was able to rid his boat of the creature with some help.
