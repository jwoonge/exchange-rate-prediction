White supremacy an ‘international terrorist problem,’ Ocasio-Cortez says at vigil for Dayton, El Paso victims
   White supremacy must be identified as terrorism under federal law, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a vigil Monday for victims of the El Paso and Dayton shootings. 
   “There are so many different issues that are weaving themselves into a braid of violence into our country. One of them is white supremacist terrorism,” Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx/Queens) told about 500 people at the vigil held at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn. 
   The freshman congresswoman has argued that while terrorism by foreign groups like Al Qaeda is defined in federal law, terrorism by domestic groups is not. 
   “White supremacy is an international terrorist problem," Ocasio-Cortez said at the vigil, referring to the New Zealand mosque shootings that took 51 lives in March. 
   She also told the group that anti-immigration rhetoric by President Trump and others “is directly responsible for what happened in El Paso.” 
   The El Paso shooter complained in an online manifesto that the U.S. is being overrun by Hispanic immigrants. 
   “I’m tired of the questioning if the president is racist. He is,” Ocasio-Cortez said. 
   Among the other speakers at the vigil was Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-Manhattan/Queens). 
   "We have more guns in America than anywhere on earth. And if guns made us safer, than we would be the safest nation earth. And are we?” Maloney asked. “No!” the crowd answered. 
   Maloney has long supported a national ban on assault weapons.
