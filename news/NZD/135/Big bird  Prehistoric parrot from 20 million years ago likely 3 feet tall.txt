   The fossilized remains of a prehistoric parrot believed to have roamed Earth approximately 20 million years ago stood 3 feet tall, claim researchers in a surprising study published on the National Geographic site. 
   The ornithological specimen, known as Heracles inexpectatus, was found in New Zealand. 
   Scientists were shocked by the enormity of this bird, believed to be the largest parrot to have ever existed. They also contend it might have feasted on other birds. 
   Tipping the scales at a formidable 15 pounds, the extinct fowl outweighs all parrot relatives. It weighed nearly twice that of the critically endangered kakapo of New Zealand. Of the more than 300 parrot species in existence, the flightless kakapo is the heaviest. 
   The fossils were discovered in 2008 in St. Bathans, New Zealand, and were originally believed to be the bones of ancient eagles. 
   “It was completely unexpected and quiet novel,” paleontologist and study lead author Trevor Worthy told National Geographic. “Once I had convinced myself it was a parrot, then I obviously had to convince the world.” 
   Heracles inexpectatus most likely lived about 23 million to 16 million years ago and probably didn’t fly. 
   Researchers believe it devoured prey on the ground that it had easy access to, according to the study. 
   Paper co-author and paleontologist Michael Archer thinks the bird might have even consumed other parrots. 
   “This was Squawkzilla,” says Archer. “This was a potential horror that was maybe eating other parrots.”
