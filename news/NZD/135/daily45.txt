Nearly $2 million of cocaine washes up on New Zealand beach
   Nearly $2 million in cocaine washed up on a New Zealand beach, police announced Friday. 
   New Zealand police were called to Bethells Beach Wednesday, where they discovered 20 packages of cocaine worth more than $3 million in New Zealand — equivalent to more than $1.9 million in American currency, authorities said in a statement. 
   New Zealand police initially reported around 19 packages had been discovered on Wednesday, but later confirmed the total to be 20. 
   Police said the drugs were those likely destined for Australasia last year. In August, two occupants on an inflatable boat were seen by the Australian Border Force and Defence patrols of the northern New South Wales Coast dropping cocaine into the ocean. The two occupants were arrested. While the majority of the drugs were recovered, portions were found on the coast of Australia from northern Queensland to New South Wales. 
   “The product found on Bethells Beach appears to have been part of this same shipment and has drifted here over the last year, as the markings and packaging of the drugs is consistent with that seized in Australia,” New Zealand police said in a statement. 
   Police are monitoring the area in case any other drugs wash on the shore. Those who may find “concerning” or “suspicious” items are urged to contact police. 
   Drugs washing onshore is not a new occurrence. 
   In late May, more than $1 million in cocaine and marijuana washed up on an Alabama shore.
