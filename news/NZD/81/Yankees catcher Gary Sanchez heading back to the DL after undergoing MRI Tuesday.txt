   A day after Gary Sanchez was ripped for failing to bust it down to first base, the Yankees catcher is heading back to the disabled list. 
   Sanchez, who missed a month of action with a strained groin, had an MRI Tuesday and it revealed he reaggravated the injury. 
   He told reporters in Tampa before Tuesday’s game that he felt his right groin “grab” during the first inning of Monday’s game. 
   Austin Romine will handle the catching chores Tuesday night with Masahiro Tanaka taking the mound for the Bombers. 
   "I should have run harder," Sanchez admitted after he appeared to jog out of the batters box and ended up making the last out at first base of the Bombers' 7-6 loss to the Rays. 
   He also loafed on another key play during the game when he didn’t hustle after a passed ball in the opening frame. 
   Sanchez had just returned to the Yankees lineup on Friday after a minor-league rehab stint at Triple-A Stanton. 
   The struggling slugger went 2-for-14 in the three games before heading back to the 10-day DL. For the season he’s hitting just .188 with 14 homers and 42 RBI. 
   He missed 20 games between June 25 and July 19. 
   Monday’s loss dropped the Yankees six game back of the AL East-leading Red Sox. The Bombers are just 13-13 over their last 26 games. 
   The Yankees recalled catcher Kyle Higashioka to take Sanchez’s spot on the roster.
