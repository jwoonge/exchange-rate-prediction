   Who says no man is an island? 
   Darrelle Revis received his own island Tuesday, courtesy of the New York Jets. 
   The cornerback, who spent a career out on an island, shutting down wide receivers for the Jets stood on a makeshift beach with three palm trees outside the Jets facilities and One Jets Drive. 
   It was fitting tribute for the retiring future Hall of Famer who signed a one-day contract to retire as Jet. 
   Too bad Revis didnâ€™t bring his swim trunks.
