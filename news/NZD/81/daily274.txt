Matt Lauer in fight over path at $9M New Zealand property
   Disgraced former NBC host Matt Lauer is in a fight with Kiwis who say he is squashing their ability to go on hikes in a beautiful lakeside park unless they pay up. 
   Lauer had bought the lease to Hunter Valley station ranch in southern New Zealand last year, which sits on the only way for the public to access Hawea Conservation Park. 
   The host was almost stripped of the property under a “good character” clause after he was accused of sexual harassment of coworkers, though officials in New Zealand allowed him to keep it last month as he had not actually been charged with a crime. 
   But now the wealthy television personality, who also owns property in the Hamptons, wants money from local officials so that residents can get to the park through his $9 million plot. 
   New Zealand’s Department of Conservation and its Walking Access Commission are advocating for more access to pass through the land, though Lauer’s lawyer Graeme Todd told Stuff.co.nz that the compensation “is likely to be considerable – most likely running into, at a minimum, hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more.” 
   He added that there were worries about safety on the road with limited cell reception. 
   But a Walking Access Commission court filing from earlier this year questioned the “optics” of “taxpayer money being paid to a very wealthy American with a tarnished reputation.” 
   “In effect, he's holding the country to ransom over this issue,” public access advocate Bruce Mason told Radio New Zealand. 
   He said that negotiations had gone poorly and was urging the New Zealand government to take over the land just around the road and make it public. 
   A government property official told Stuff that his office is looking into the issue and obtaining advice about the financial impact to Lauer.
