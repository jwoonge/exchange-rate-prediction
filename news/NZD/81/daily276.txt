'Tremendous coach, better person'  Giants' Pat Shurmur, NFL Twitter reacts to death of Tony Sparano
   The death of former Jets offensive coordinator Tony Sparano shocked the NFL world Sunday, as players and coaches around the league took to social media to bid farewell to the longtime coach. 
   Sparano, set to enter his third season as the Vikings’ offensive line coach, spent nearly two decades on the NFL sidelines, including one campaign in 2012 with Gang Green as offensive coordinator. 
   The 56-year-old reportedly experienced chest pains recently, but was released from the hospital after taking tests. 
   “I worked with Tony for the past two years in Minnesota,” Giants coach Pat Shurmur said in a statement. “We both showed up the same time. We were the new guys, we quickly became friends and it didn’t take long for me to realize and respect what a good person and good coach he was. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jeanette and the kids. What a tremendous coach and an even better person. I’m proud to have been his friend.”
