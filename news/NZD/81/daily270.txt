Matt Lauer still has ties at NBC News, where colleagues believe a professional comeback is possible
   Axed “Today” host Matt Lauer is still on good terms with some of his former NBC News colleagues, according to a report. 
   Lauer, who was fired from the network after being accused of sexual harassment, still has supporters at the company, Us Weekly reports. 
   “Some people feel Matt was unfairly targeted and would love to see him back on television in some capacity,” a source reportedly told the media outlet. 
   The same source reportedly said that Lauer, 60, hadn’t given up hope of returning to the network, saying he “had hoped that he could get a deal with an NBC subsidiary.” The source added that the scenario would be “extremely unlikely because of fears of negative publicity.” 
   Another former colleague believes Lauer still has a shot at a “professional comeback,” according to the report. 
   Lauer spoke publicly Tuesday for the first time since his dismissal about eight months ago, to claim in an interview about a land dispute involving his New Zealand ranch that he’s being unfairly targeted because of his high-profile firing. 
   “In my opinion, and I don’t think I’m being a conspiracy theorist here or paranoid, I believe the groups behind this are in some ways unfortunately taking advantage of some difficult times I’ve been through over the past six months, and I think they see me as an easy mark,” he told RNZ “Checkpoint” host John Campbell.
