   Saquon Barkley will ring in Giants training camp with a newly signed NFL contract. 
   The Giants inked their first-round draft pick to a four-year, fully guaranteed contract worth $31.2 million Sunday, the Daily News confirmed, giving Barkley the fourth-highest average annual running back salary in the league. 
   Only Le’Veon Bell, Devonta Freeman and LeSean McCoy are slated to earn more. 
   Barkley will receive a $20.76 million signing bonus, with $15 million paid out immediately. 
   The Giants also signed fifth-round draft pick RJ McIntosh on Sunday. After inking the defensive tackle, the Giants have now signed all six of their 2018 draft picks. 
   The former Penn State standout reported for camp Sunday alongside fellow rookies, quarterbacks and select veteran players. 
   Giants brass took a calculated gamble skipping out on a quarterback to take Barkley with the second pick of the NFL draft, a move signifying management is going all-in with Eli Manning at the helm. 
   Barkley, 21, will be the main attraction once training camp gets underway Thursday in East Rutherford. 
   With Barkley locked up, the Giants can now turn their attention to another star in need of a fresh contract. 
   Odell Beckham Jr. is still without a long-term extension, as it remains to be seen whether the wideout will show up for camp later this week. 
   Back in June, Beckham said he’d be at training camp, though a source told The News he may change his mind if the situation isn’t resolved in the near-future. 
   A holdout would cost Beckham $40,000 a day in fines during training camp.
