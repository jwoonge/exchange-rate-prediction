French tourist bodyboarding in New Zealand survives shark attack
   A French Tourist on Thursday was recovering in a New Zealand hospital after a shark mauled her leg during a beach day with friends. 
   Caitlin Surf School owner Nick Smart was just finishing up a class when the shark set in on the woman, who was bodyboarding in Porpoise Bay near the Southern tip of the island. 
   "I saw somebody running and instantly had a very strong feeling things were not right," Smart said, noting she had been enjoying the sunny afternoon with her boyfriend and another French couple. 
   The woman's friends dragged her out of the water and used towels to apply pressure on her wounds while Smart drove down to the surf from which she was being pulled. 
   He told Radio NZ he returned to his office to get a stretcher and then carried the injured woman to his friend's house on the beach, where they waited about 40 minutes for a helicopter. 
   "She handled it really, really well," Smart said. "She was calm, not at all hysterical. I assured her she wasn't going to die, and that a helicopter was coming. She was in a bit of shock." 
   The woman, who appeared to be in her 20s, was airlifted to Dunedin Hospital about 100 miles away. A duty manager there said she was in stable condition. Her injuries were still being assessed, the manager said. 
   Smart couldn't see the extent of the woman's injuries through her wetsuit, but said it was apparent that she lost a lot of blood. 
   Shark attacks are relatively rare in New Zealand, according The Guardian. The last recorded fatality was a 47-year-old who was attacked at tourist beach near Auckland in 2013. Before that, there had not been a death tied to a shark attack since 1976.
