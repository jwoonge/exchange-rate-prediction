   Everyone loves penguins. They have a cute waddle, wear tuxedos, are fierce (remember the NatGeo Wild "homewrecker" penguin?), and are excellent tap dancers. 
   Here are some fun facts about penguins. 
   1. Although covered in tiny feathers, penguins are flightless. Rather than soar, they waddle. And while there are many other earthbound birds, penguins surely are the cutest. 
   2. Penguins are great swimmers. Their wings function more like flippers. They typically swim 4 to 7 miles per hour, although the fastest, the gentoo penguin, can swim up to 22 miles per hour. Pretty fast! 
   3. Although Chilly Willy, arguably the most famous penguin, lived in Alaska, non-animated penguins overwhelmingly live in the Southern Hemisphere, and can be found in Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Peru. Some, however, reside in the Galapagos, which is near the equator. 
   4. Penguins live mainly off of krill, a tiny crustaceon, but they may soon be forced to go on a diet: Krill, like some other undersea creatures, are threatened by climate change and warming water. 
   5. Penguins can actually drink salt water! They have glands just above their eyes that filter the salt, which they eventually expel â€” by sneezing. The cutest, right? 
   6. You've heard of black swans? Well, meet the brown penguin. Isabelline penguins are very rare, occurring once for every 50,000 "regular" penguins, and they have it rough. Since they don't blend in with the crowd, they're more vulnerable to predators, and are often overlooked by mates. Poor brown penguin!
