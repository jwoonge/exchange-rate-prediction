SEE IT  101-year-old woman wins 100-meter dash at World Masters GamesÂ 
   The 100-year-old dash. 
   Man Kaur, a 101-year-old woman from India, won the 100-meter dash at the World Masters Games in New Zealand after being the only runner in the 100+ age category. Kaur made history as the oldest female athlete to win a gold medal in the race, CNN reports. 
   In addition to winning the 100-meter dash in 74 seconds, Kaur also won the 200-meter dash and the shot-put events. She'll also be competing in the javelin throw on Thursday. 
   Kaur has overall good health despite battling severe osteoporosis and a curved spine. She doesn't plan to quit anytime soon. 
   "I will run as long as Guru's (God's) grace is with me. Although I am in such a state of health and I have improved my performance in these games, I will definitely perform better if there is some medical help," Kaur told CNN. 
   The 101-year-old also ran in the American Masters Games in Canada last summer when she competed in the running, shot-put and javelin events there. 
   Kaur didn't start getting involved in athletics until she was 93. Her son, Punjab, noticed she could run well and talked her into competing at the World Masters Games. 
   The World Masters games are considered by many to be the Olympics for veterans. They're held every four years and it's for people that are usually 35 or older.
