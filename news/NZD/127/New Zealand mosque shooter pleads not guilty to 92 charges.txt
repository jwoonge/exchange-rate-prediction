   A man suspected of killing 51 people in a New Zealand mosque pleaded not guilty Friday to all charges against him. 
   Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, faces 51 murder charges, 40 attempted murder charges and one terrorism charge. 
   He entered the not guilty pleas through his attorneys as victims and their family members packed the Christchurch courtroom. 
   Tarrant was not present in court. Instead, he watched the proceedings via a video hookup from Paremoremo Prison in Auckland, the New Zealand Herald reported. 
   Tarrant is accused of killing 51 people at two mosques during the partially live-streamed attacks in Christchurch on March 15. 
   His trial has been set for next year.
