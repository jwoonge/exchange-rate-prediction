   Friendship never ends — even on the silver screen. 
   The Spice Girls, the iconic Brit 1990s pop quintet, is pooling its collective talent together yet again, this time for an animated film. 
   “(The band) had an idea that we’ve been developing,” Paramount Animation President Mireille Soria told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday. 
   All five gals: Baby, Ginger, Posh, Scary and Sporty, who are currently touring the United Kingdom, say they’re on board with the project. 
   “Another #SpiceGirls movie!!!” wrote Elmer Emmanuel on social media. “(32-year-old me) and (10-year-old) me are freaking out.” 
   The untitled feature, which has yet to receive a release date, will reportedly include old Spice Girls classics as well as new compositions. 
   But not everyone is eagerly awaiting the premiere. 
   "We already had a (Spice) Girls movie and still have nightmares of how bad it was, scoffed Twitter user Sean McCabe. “The world is not ready for another one.” 
   The group dominated the airwaves in the late 1990s with smash hits “Wannabe,” “Say You’ll Be There” and “2 Become 1.” All three singles peaked at No. 1 on the U.K. charts while cresting in the Top 5 in the U.S. 
   The band’s debut album “Spice" sold an extraordinary 23 million copies worldwide and hit No. 1 in the U.S., Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands and New Zealand.
