Adele doesn’t know if she’ll ever tour again 
   Adele may never say hello to a new tour again. 
   The powerhouse singer told fans at her New Zealand show Sunday that she's unsure if she'll ever tour again after she concludes her sprawling run of concerts this summer. 
   "Touring isn't something I'm good at ... applause makes me feel a bit vulnerable," she told the audience at Mt Smart Stadium, according to the New Zealand Herald. "I don't know if I will ever tour again. The only reason I've toured is you. I'm not sure if touring is my bag." 
   Adele concluded the third leg of her ongoing "Adele Live 2017" tour Sunday in front of 40,000 spectators at the arena in Auckland. She has just four shows remaining in the fourth and final leg, each of which will take place at London's famed Wembley Stadium. 
   The "Hello" singer began the massive tour — then called "Adele Live 2016" — last February in support of her acclaimed album "25" and has put on over 100 shows since. 
   If she ends up hanging up the mic later this year, fans will surely be rolling in the deep emotion. Adele typically sells out concerts and has made headlines for her candid commentary and memorable gimmicks like inviting people to get engaged onstage throughout the tour. 
   Her latest gig at the outdoor venue in Auckland was marred by rain, forcing Adele to spend much of the concert in a poncho. 
   "I just spent two hours in hair and makeup for nothing," she joked at the concert, which was her third in Auckland in four days. 
   Adele, 28, dominated last month's Grammys by winning each of the three most coveted awards: Song of the Year and Record of the Year for "Hello" and album of the year for "25."
