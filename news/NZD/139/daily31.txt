SEE IT  Man catches stranger’s phone on roller coaster in viral video
   A man’s lightning-fast reflexes were caught on video when he caught a stranger’s phone while riding a roller coaster in Catalonia, Spain. 
   Samuel Kempf, a New Zealand native, was visiting the PortAventura World theme park when he took a ride on the Shambhala roller coaster last month. 
   A camera mounted to the ride captured the moment he caught the camera while riding the 80 mph coaster. He told a local news station that he returned the phone to the owner when the ride ended. 
   “He couldn’t believe it. He gave me a big hug,” Kempf said.
